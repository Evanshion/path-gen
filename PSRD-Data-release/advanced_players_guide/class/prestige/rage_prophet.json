Rage prophets can dispense advice through their communion with the spirits and ability to divine the future.</p><p>Rage prophets are always barbarian/oracles, though some have levels in other classes as well. The most popular oracle mystery among rage prophets is that of battle, for skill in battle is respected in barbarian society, but oracles of all mysteries find their way into positions as war-chiefs, counselors, and leaders. Some rage prophets choose to live apart or to act as wandering champions, belonging to all tribes and none, following the lead of their spirit guides rather than the dictates of any one tribal chief or council. Though sometimes looked at askance by tribal leaders, these wanderers are popular with many barbarians, who see them as the perfect exemplars of the strength, virtue, and power of the free folk, owing nothing to anyone but the sky above, the earth beneath, and the spirits within.</p>",
