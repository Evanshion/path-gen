The redirected spell behaves in all ways as if its new target were the original target for the spell. Spells that affect a target in any way (including a lesser effect from a successful saving throw) may not be redirected in this manner. A bouncing spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.</p>",
