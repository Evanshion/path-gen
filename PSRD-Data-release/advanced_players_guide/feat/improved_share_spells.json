The creature must be within 5 feet of you at the time of casting to receive the benefit. The spell's duration is halved between you and your bonded creature (for example, a spell with a duration of 1 hour has a duration of 30 minutes for both you and your bonded creature).</p><p class=\"stat-block-2\">If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the creature if it moves farther than 5 feet away from you. It does not affect the creature again if it returns before the duration expires. </p><p class=\"stat-block-2\">You may share spells in this fashion even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of that type. </p><p class=\"stat-block-2\">This feat only applies to animal companions, eidolons, familiars, or special mounts gained through a class feature.</p>",
