A reach spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level for each increase in range category. For example, a spell with a range of touch increased to long range uses up a spell slot three levels higher. Spells modified by this feat that require melee touch attacks instead require ranged touch attacks.</p><p class=\"stat-block-2\">Spells that do not have a range of touch, close, or medium do not benefit from this feat.</p>",
