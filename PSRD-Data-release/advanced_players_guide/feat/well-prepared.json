For example, having a crowbar would be DC 12, whereas a flask of acid would be DC 20. The item must be something you can easily carry&mdash;if you are on foot and have only a backpack, for example, you could not have a large iron cauldron. You cannot have magical items using this feat, nor can you have specific items, such as the key to a particular door. If you are stripped of your equipment or possessions, you lose the benefits of this feat until you have at least a day to resupply and &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; new items. You must pay for these items normally.</p>",
