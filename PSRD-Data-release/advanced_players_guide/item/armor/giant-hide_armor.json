Once per day on command, the wearer can grow to match the size of the appropriate giant, as if using <i>giant form I</i> (ogre, troll, hill giant, stone giant, fire giant, or frost giant) or <i>giant form II</i> (cloud giant or storm giant). This transformation lasts up to 15 minutes, and ends when the wearer commands. Most good folk consider wearing the skins of intelligent creatures to be abhorrent. Giants gain a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against the wearer, or +4 if the wearer's armor is made from the same kind of giant as the attacker.</p>",
