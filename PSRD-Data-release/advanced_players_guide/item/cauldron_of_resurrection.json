When the cauldron is filled with pure water and certain rare and sacred herbs, and a deceased creature is placed inside it, the cauldron can restore the creature to life as if from a <i>raise dead</i> or <i>resurrection</i> spell. The spell effect depends on the components used: <i>raise dead</i> costs 5,000 gp worth of materials, while <i>resurrection</i> costs 10,000 gp worth of materials. The cauldron can function once per day.</p>",
