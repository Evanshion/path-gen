A successful hit with a <i>lance of jousting</i> on a mounted opponent forces the target to make a Ride check (DC 10 + damage dealt) to avoid being knocked from the saddle. Although used in combat to remove a mounted foe's advantage, use of a <i>lance of jousting</i> in a tournament or similar contest is generally considered a dishonorable form of cheating.</p>",
