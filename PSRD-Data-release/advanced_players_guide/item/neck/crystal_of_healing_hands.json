A person with the lay on hands class feature can direct one use of this energy into the crystal, which stores it until the wearer speaks a command word to release it. Releasing the energy targets the wearer with the stored lay on hands effect, as if touched by the person who infused the crystal with its power. The crystal can contain a single use of the lay on hands class feature. When filled with this magic, it begins to glow with a pearly white light. The wearer of the crystal can order it to release its energy as a standard action. This acts identically to receiving the lay on hands directly from the person who channeled it into the crystal, including any mercies they had at the time.</p>",
