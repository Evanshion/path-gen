If the <i>reaver's scythe</i> kills a creature, either through damage or because the creature failed its Will save, the wielder immediately receives 1 hero point. This hero point must be used within 1 hour or it is lost. The wielder cannot gain another hero point from the scythe until the first is used or lost.</p>",
