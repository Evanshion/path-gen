The wearer can, as a swift action, order the cape to transform into a faint sphere of force that surrounds him on all sides. The field grants the wearer a concealment (20% miss chance) against ranged attacks and lasts for 1 minute or until the wearer is missed by a ranged attack due to the power of the cloak, whichever comes first. When the field ends, all magic is lost from the cloak, leaving only a mundane silvery garment.</p>",
