The spells gained are cumulative with any existing spells per day the character might have, even from paladin class levels. The <i>Shield of the Sun</i> also grants its wielder spell resistance 15. It absorbs the first 10 points of damage from any energy attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic). In return for all this, once per year the shield's owner must undertake a quest at the behest of a lawful good deity (no saving throw to avoid). </p><p>A chaotic or evil character gains four negative levels when wielding the <i>Shield of the Sun</i>. The negative levels persist as long as the shield is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including <i>restoration</i> spells). The negative levels disappear when the shield is stowed or leaves the wearer's possession.</p>",
