Once applied, the wearer can, as a swift action, make the paint rearrange itself into a ghastly m\u00e9lange of colors, making his appearance momentarily disturbing and hideous. The wearer chooses one creature who can see his painted face within 30 feet to be affected by<i> cause fear</i> (DC 11). Once the paint is used in this fashion, it loses all magic and becomes normal face paint. Once applied, the wearer has 24 hours to use the paint's magic; otherwise it fades away.</p>",
