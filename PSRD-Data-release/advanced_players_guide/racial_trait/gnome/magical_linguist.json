    "body": "<p id=\"magical-linguist\">Gnomes study languages in both their mundane and supernatural manifestations. Gnomes with this racial trait add +1 to the DC of spells they cast with the language-dependent descriptor or those that create glyphs, symbols, or other magical writings. They gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against such spells. Gnomes with a Charisma of 11 or higher also gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day&mdash;<i>arcane mark</i>, <i>comprehend languages</i>, <i>message</i>, <i>read magic</i>. The caster level for these effects is equal to the gnome's level. This racial trait replaces the gnome magic and illusion resistance racial traits.</p>",
