    "body": "<p id=\"pit-fighter\">At 3rd level, the brutal pugilist has learned combat tricks from fighting in pit brawls and gladiatorial arenas. She selects one combat maneuver and gains a +1 insight bonus on her CMB or to her CMD in that maneuver. This bonus increases to +2 if the barbarian is wearing no armor (shields are allowed). At every three levels after 3rd, the barbarian may select another combat maneuver and add this bonus on her CMB or to her CMD. This bonus can be applied to each maneuver no more than twice, once on CMB and once to CMD. This ability replaces trap sense.</p>",
