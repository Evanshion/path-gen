    "body": "<p id=\"elemental-rage\">While raging, all of the barbarian's melee attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). The type is chosen when the barbarian begins her rage. A barbarian must have the lesser elemental rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power. Note that the barbarian can still use her lesser elemental rage power while using this rage power, but she must select a different energy type.</p>",
