    "body": "<p id=\"energy-absorption\">While raging, the barbarian can absorb energy from a single attack of her chosen energy type once per rage. She does not make a saving throw against the effect but takes no damage from it, instead gaining 1 temporary hit point per 3 points of damage the attack would have inflicted. These temporary hit points last until the end of the barbarian's rage. A barbarian must have the greater energy resistance rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>",
