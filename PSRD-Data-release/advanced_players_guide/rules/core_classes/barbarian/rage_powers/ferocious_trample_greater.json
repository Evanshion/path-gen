In addition, it can make an overrun combat maneuver check as a free action against a creature that fails its Reflex save (or chooses not to save in order to take an attack of opportunity) against its trample. A barbarian must have the ferocious trample rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>",
