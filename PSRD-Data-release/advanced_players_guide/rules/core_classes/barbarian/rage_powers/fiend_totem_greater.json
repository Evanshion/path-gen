Good creatures adjacent to the barbarian are shaken and take 2d6 points of slashing damage at the beginning of the barbarian's turn as dozens of small cuts open across their flesh. Neutral creatures that are adjacent to the barbarian are shaken, but do not take any damage. Evil creatures are unaffected. A barbarian must have the fiend totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.</p>",
