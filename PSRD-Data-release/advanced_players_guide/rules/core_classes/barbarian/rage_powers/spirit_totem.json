    "body": "<p id=\"spirit-totem\">While raging, the spirits that surround the barbarian make it difficult for her enemies to see her. The spirits grant the barbarian a 20% miss chance against ranged attacks and melee attacks made by creatures that are not adjacent to the barbarian (typically due to reach). A barbarian must have the lesser spirit totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>",
