    "body": "<p id=\"mockery\">A court bard of 3rd level or higher can subtly ridicule and defame a specific individual. The bard selects one target who can hear his performance. That individual takes a &ndash;2 penalty on Charisma checks and Charisma-related skill checks as long as the bard continues performing. This penalty increases by &ndash;1 every four levels after 3rd. Mockery is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that relies on audible components. This performance replaces inspire competence.</p>",
