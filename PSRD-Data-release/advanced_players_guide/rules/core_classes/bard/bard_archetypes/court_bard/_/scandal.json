    "body": "<p id=\"scandal\">A court bard of 14th level or higher can combine salacious gossip and biting calumny to incite a riot. Each enemy within 30 feet is affected as if by a <i>song of discord</i> for as long as it can hear the performance. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect, and that creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. Scandal is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that uses audible components. This performance replaces frightening tune.</p>",
