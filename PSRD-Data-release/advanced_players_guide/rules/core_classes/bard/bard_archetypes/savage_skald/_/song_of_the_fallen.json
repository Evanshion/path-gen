    "body": "<p id=\"song-of-the-fallen\">At 10th level, a savage skald can duplicate the effect of a <i>horn of Valhalla</i>. This effect requires 10 continuous rounds of performance and summons barbarians as a silver horn at 10th level, as a brass horn at 13th level, as a bronze horn at 16th level, and as an iron horn at 19th level. The warriors remain only as long as the bard continues his performance. This ability requires audible components. This performance replaces jack of all trades.</p>",
