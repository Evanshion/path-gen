    "body": "<p id=\"call-the-storm\">At 18th level, a sea singer can use performance to duplicate <i>control water, control weather, control winds</i>, or <i>storm of vengeance</i>, using his bard level as the caster level. Using this ability requires 1 round of continuous performance per level of the spell (as if he were a druid). These effects continue for as long as the bard continues performing (the effects on <i>control weather</i> happen immediately), but not longer than the spell's normal duration. This performance replaces mass suggestion.</p>",
