The target must make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier) each round that it hears or sees the performance, or it takes one of the following random effects each round: 1&mdash;blinded, 2&mdash;dazzled, 3&mdash;deafened, 4&mdash;entangled, 5&mdash;fall prone, 6&mdash;nauseated. Each effect lasts 1 round. This performance replaces inspire greatness. </p>",
