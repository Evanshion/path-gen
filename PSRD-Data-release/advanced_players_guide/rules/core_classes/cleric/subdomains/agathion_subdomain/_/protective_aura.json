    "body": "<p id=\"protective-aura\">At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot protective aura as a standard action. Allies in this aura receive a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws. In addition, allies in the area gain the benefits of <i>protection from evil</i> (although the AC bonus and saving throw bonus do not stack with those granted by this effect). You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. These rounds do not have to be consecutive.</p>",
