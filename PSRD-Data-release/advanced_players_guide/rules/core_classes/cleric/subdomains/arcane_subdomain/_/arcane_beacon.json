    "body": "<p id=\"arcane-beacon\">As a standard action you can become a beacon of arcane energy until the end of your next turn. The aura emanates 15 feet from you. All arcane spells cast within the aura either gain a +1 bonus to their caster level or increase their saving throw DC by +1. The caster chooses the benefit when she casts the spell. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. </p>",
