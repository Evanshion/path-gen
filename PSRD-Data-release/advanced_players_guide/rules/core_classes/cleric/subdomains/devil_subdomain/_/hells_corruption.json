    "body": "<p id=\"hell's-corruption\">You can cause a creature to become more susceptible to corruption as a melee touch attack. Creatures touched take a &ndash;2 penalty on all saving throws and must roll all opposed skill checks twice, taking the worse result. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your cleric level (minimum 1). You can use this ability for a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>",
