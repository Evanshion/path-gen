    "body": "<p id=\"door-sight\">You can lay your hand upon any surface and see what is on the other side, as if using <i>clairvoyance</i>. Using this power takes 1 minute, during which time you must be touching the surface you want to see through. You can keep looking for as long as 10 minutes with each use of this power, but must touch the surface and take no other action the entire time. The surface cannot be thicker than 6 inches plus 1 inch per cleric level you possess. You can use this power a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>",
