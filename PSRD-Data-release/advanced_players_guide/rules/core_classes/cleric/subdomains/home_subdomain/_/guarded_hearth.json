    "body": "<p id=\"guarded-hearth\">At 8th level, you can create a ward that protects a specified area. Creating this ward takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted work. This ward has a maximum radius of 5 feet per 2 cleric levels you possess. When the ward is completed, you designate any number of creatures inside its area. Should any other creature enter the warded area, all of the selected creatures are immediately alerted (and awoken if they were asleep). The designated creatures also receive a sacred bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier on all saving throws and attack rolls while inside the warded area. This ward immediately ends if you leave the area. The ward lasts for 1 hour per cleric level. You can use this ability once per day.</p>",
