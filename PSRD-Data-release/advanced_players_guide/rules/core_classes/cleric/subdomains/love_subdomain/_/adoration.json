    "body": "<p id=\"adoration\">As an immediate action, you can attempt to thwart a melee or ranged attack that targets you. This ability functions as <i>sanctuary</i>, but only against one individual attack. You must use the ability after the attack is declared but before the roll is made. The creature attacking you receives a Will save to negate this effect. If a creature has more than one attack, this ability only affects one of the attacks. You can use the ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>",
