These unarmed strikes do not provoke attacks of opportunity, but attacking with both uses the two-weapon fighting rules as normal. In addition, these unarmed strikes ignore the hardness of items with a hardness of 10 or less. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>",
