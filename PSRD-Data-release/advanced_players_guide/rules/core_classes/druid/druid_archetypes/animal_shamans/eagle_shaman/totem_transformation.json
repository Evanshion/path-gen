This ability functions as the bear shaman ability, but the druid may select from the following bonuses: movement (fly speed 30 feet [average], the druid must be 5th level to select this bonus), senses (low-light vision, +4 racial bonus to Perception), or natural weapons (bite [1d4], 2 talons [1d4] for a Medium shaman). While using totem transformation, the eagle shaman may speak normally and can cast <i>speak with animals</i> (birds only) at will.</p>",
