This ability functions as the bear shaman ability, but the druid may select from the following bonuses: movement (+20 enhancement bonus to land speed), senses (low-light vision, scent, +4 racial bonus to Survival when tracking by scent), or natural weapons (bite [1d4 plus trip] for a Medium druid, +2 CMB to trip). While using totem transformation, the wolf shaman may speak normally and can cast <i>speak with animals</i> (canines only) at will.</p>",
