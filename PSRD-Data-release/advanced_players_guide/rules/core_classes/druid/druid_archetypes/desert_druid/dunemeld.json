    "body": "<p id=\"dunemeld\">At 13th level, a desert druid can assume the form of a swirling mass of sand at will. This is equivalent to <i>gaseous form</i>, but the druid gains a land and burrow speed of 10 feet rather than a fly speed. While in this form, the druid gains a circumstance bonus on Stealth checks made in desert terrain equal to her druid level. This ability replaces a thousand faces. </p>",
