A desert druid cannot use wild shape to adopt a plant form. At 10th level she can assume the form of a Small or Medium vermin, at 12th level a Tiny or Large vermin, and at 14th level a Diminutive or Huge vermin. This effect functions as <i>beast shape IV</i> (treating the vermin as an animal to determine its ability and natural armor modifiers).</p>",
