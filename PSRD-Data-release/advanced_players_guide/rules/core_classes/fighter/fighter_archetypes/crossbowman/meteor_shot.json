    "body": "<p id=\"meteor-shot\">At 17th level, as a standard action, a crossbowman can make one attack with a crossbow at a &ndash;4 penalty. If the attack hits, it inflicts damage normally and the target is subject to a bull rush or a trip maneuver using the attack roll as the combat maneuver check. The crossbowman must decide which maneuver to attempt before making his attack roll. This ability replaces weapon training 4.</p>",
