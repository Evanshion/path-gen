    "body": "<p id=\"interference\">At 13th level, a free hand fighter can make a disarm or trip combat maneuver against a target he threatens as a move action to push his opponent off balance. If successful, the target becomes flat-footed. This condition lasts until the target takes damage from a melee or ranged attack or until the beginning of the free hand fighter's next turn, whichever comes first. This ability replaces weapon training 3.</p>",
