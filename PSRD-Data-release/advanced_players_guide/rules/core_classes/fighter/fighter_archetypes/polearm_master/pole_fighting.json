    "body": "<p id=\"pole-fighting\">At 2nd level, as an immediate action, a polearm master can shorten the grip on his spear or polearm with reach and use it against adjacent targets. This action results in a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls with that weapon until he spends another immediate action to return to the normal grip. The penalty is reduced by &ndash;1 for every four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.</p>",
