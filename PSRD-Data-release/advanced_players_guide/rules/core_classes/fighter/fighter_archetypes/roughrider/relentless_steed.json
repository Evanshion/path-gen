    "body": "<p id=\"relentless-steed\">At 11th level, a roughrider's mount does not reduce its speed when wearing heavy barding or carrying a heavy load. The roughrider may also reroll a Ride skill check or a saving throw made by the mount once per day, but must use the second roll even if it is worse. This ability may be used one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 11th. This ability replaces armor training 3.</p>",
