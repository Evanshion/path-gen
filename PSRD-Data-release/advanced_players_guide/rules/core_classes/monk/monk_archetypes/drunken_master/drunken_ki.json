    "body": "<p id=\"drunken-ki\">At 3rd level, a drunken master can drink a tankard of ale or strong alcohol and gain one temporary <i>ki</i> point. The act of drinking is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The monk can have a maximum number of drunken <i>ki</i> points equal to 1 plus one additional point for every two levels thereafter (5th, 7th, and so on). The monk can gain this temporary <i>ki</i> even before he gains a <i>ki</i> pool at 4th level. These drunken <i>ki</i> points last for 1 hour or until spent, whichever is shorter. As long as he has at least 1 drunken <i>ki</i> point, the monk can spend 1 <i>ki</i> point as a swift action to move 5 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity. This ability replaces still mind.</p>",
