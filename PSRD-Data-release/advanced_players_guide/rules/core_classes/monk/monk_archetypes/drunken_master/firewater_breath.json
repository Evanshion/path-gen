    "body": "<p id=\"firewater-breath\">At 19th level, a drunken master can take a drink and expel a gout of alcohol-fueled fire in a 30-foot cone. Creatures within the cone take 20d6 points of fire damage. A successful Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis modifier) halves the damage. Using this ability is a standard action that consumes 4 <i>ki</i> points from the monk's <i>ki</i> pool. The monk must have at least 1 drunken <i>ki</i> point to use this ability. This ability replaces empty body.</p>",
