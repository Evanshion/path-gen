    "body": "<p id=\"life-funnel\">At 7th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal a creature's life force to replenish his own. If the monk has at least 1 <i>ki</i> point in his <i>ki</i> pool and scores a confirmed critical hit against a living enemy or reduces a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, he heals a number of hit points equal to his monk level. As with steal <i>ki</i>, some monks believe that life funnel is an unsavory act, no better than what the undead do to the living. A monk with this ability cannot steal both <i>ki</i> and hit points at the same time. This ability replaces wholeness of body.</p>",
