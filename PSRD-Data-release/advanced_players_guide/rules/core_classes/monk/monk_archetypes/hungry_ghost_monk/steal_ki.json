    "body": "<p id=\"steal-ki\">At 5th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal <i>ki</i> from other creatures, though this ability is controversial in some circles of monks, who see it as nothing less than a form of vampirism. If the monk scores a confirmed critical hit against a living enemy or reduces a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, he can steal some of that creature's<i> ki</i>. This ability replenishes 1 spent <i>ki</i> point to the monk's <i>ki</i> pool, as long as the monk has at least 1 <i>ki</i> point in his pool. He cannot exceed his <i>ki</i> pool's maximum. At 11th level, each time the monk successfully steals <i>ki</i>, he can make an immediate saving throw against one disease he is suffering from. There is no penalty for failing this saving throw. The monk gains a bonus equal to his Wisdom modifier on the saving throw. This ability replaces purity of body.</p>",
