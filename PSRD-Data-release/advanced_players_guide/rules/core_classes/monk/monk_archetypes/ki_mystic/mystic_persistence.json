    "body": "<p id=\"mystic-persistence\">At 19th level, a <i>ki</i> mystic can create an aura once per day as a swift action at the cost of at least 2 points of <i>ki</i>. The aura emanates out to a 20-foot radius. The monk and all allies within the aura can roll two dice when making an attack roll or a saving throw and take the better result. The aura lasts for 1 round, plus an additional round for every 2 <i>ki</i> points spent when the monk created the aura. The monk can dismiss the aura at any time as a free action, but the <i>ki</i> points for the full duration of the aura are lost. This ability replaces empty body.</p>",
