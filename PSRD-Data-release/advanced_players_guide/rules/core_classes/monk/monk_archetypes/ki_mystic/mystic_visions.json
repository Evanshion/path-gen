    "body": "<p id=\"mystic-visions\">At 11th level, a <i>ki</i> mystic may receive mystic visions when he rests. These visions can come as a dream, an epiphany, or even as the voice of an old friend whispering in the monk's mind. The effect is similar to a <i>divination</i> spell with a caster level equal to the monk's level. The <i>divination</i> has no casting time; it is just part of the normal dreams or visions that occur every night. Using this ability costs 2 <i>ki</i> points that are removed from the next day's total. This ability replaces diamond body.</p>",
