    "body": "<p id=\"ki-weapons\">At 5th level, a monk of the empty hand may spend 1 point from his <i>ki</i> pool as a swift action to deal damage equal to his unarmed strike damage with an improvised weapon for 1 round. At 11th level, the monk may spend <i>ki</i> to grant an enhancement bonus or magical weapon abilities to an improvised weapon for 1 round, at the rate of 1 point of <i>ki</i> per +1 bonus or its equivalent. The monk may not spend more than 3 points of <i>ki</i> at one time for this purpose. For example, a monk can spend 2 points of <i>ki</i> to give his improvised weapon a +1 enhancement bonus and the <i>ki focus</i> quality, or just the <i>flaming burst</i> quality. At 15th level, the limit increases to 5 <i>ki</i> per round. The monk may use this ability to add magical weapon qualities to improvised weapons that could not normally have such a quality, such as adding the <i>disruption</i> quality to a slashing weapon, or the <i>vorpal</i> quality to a bludgeoning weapon. This ability replaces purity of body and diamond body.</p>",
