He gains a fly speed equal to his land speed, but he must end each turn on the ground. If the monk does not land by the end of his turn, he falls from whatever height he has attained. The ki-rin is honorable, honest, and self-sacrificing&mdash;a monk must be lawful good to take on the aspect of the ki-rin. </p>",
