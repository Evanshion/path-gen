He can assume <i>gaseous form</i> (as the spell) as a standard action for 1 minute per day per monk level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The oni is treacherous and deceitful, and it hungers for the pain and death of living creatures&mdash;a monk must be evil to take on the aspect of the oni.</p>",
