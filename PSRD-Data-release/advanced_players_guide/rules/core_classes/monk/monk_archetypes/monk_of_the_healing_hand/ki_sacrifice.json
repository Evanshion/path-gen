At the end of the ritual, the monk sacrifices all of his<i> ki</i> in order to cast <i>raise dead</i> (as the spell) with a caster level equal to his monk level. The ritual uses all of the <i>ki</i> in the monk's <i>ki</i> pool; the monk must have at least 6 points of <i>ki</i> in his <i>ki</i> pool to use this ability. At 15th level, the monk may sacrifice his <i>ki</i> to cast <i>resurrection</i>. The monk must have at least 8 points of <i>ki</i> in his <i>ki</i> pool to use this ability. These rituals do not require material components. When this ability is used, the monk's <i>ki</i> pool is not replenished until 24 hours have passed. This ability replaces both diamond body and quivering palm.</p>",
