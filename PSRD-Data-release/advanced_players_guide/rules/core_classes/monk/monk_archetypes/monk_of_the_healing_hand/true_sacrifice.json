    "body": "<p id=\"true-sacrifice\">At 20th level, in a final selfless act, a monk of the healing hand can draw in his entire <i>ki</i>, which then explodes outward in a 50-foot-radius emanation. All dead allies within the emanation are brought back to life, as if they were the subject of a <i>true resurrection</i> spell with a caster level equal to the monk's level. When the monk does this, he is truly and utterly destroyed. A monk destroyed in this way can never come back to life, not even by way of a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell or by the power of a deity. Furthermore, the monk's name can never be spoken or written down again. All written mentions of his name become nothing more than a blank space. This ability replaces perfect self.</p>",
