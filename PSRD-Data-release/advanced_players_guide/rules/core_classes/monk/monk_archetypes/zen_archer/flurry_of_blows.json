    "body": "<p id=\"flurry-of-blows\">Starting at 1st level, a zen archer can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action, but only when using a bow (even though it is a ranged weapon). He may not make a flurry of blows with his unarmed attacks or any other weapons. A zen archer does not apply his Strength bonus on damage rolls made with flurry of blows unless he is using a composite bow with a Strength rating. A zen archer's flurry of blows otherwise functions as normal for a monk of his level.</p><p>A zen archer cannot use Rapid Shot or Manyshot when making a flurry of blows with his bow.</p>",
