    "body": "<p id=\"ki-arrows\">At 5th level, a zen archer may spend 1 point from his <i>ki</i> pool as a swift action to change the damage dice of arrows he shoots to that of his unarmed strikes. This lasts until the start of his next turn. For example, a Medium zen archer's short bow normally deals 1d6 damage; using this ability, his arrows deal 1d8 damage until the start of his next turn. This ability replaces purity of body.</p>",
