    "body": "<p id=\"unholy-champion\">At 20th level, an antipaladin becomes a conduit for the might of the dark powers. His DR increases to 10/good. Whenever he uses smite good and successfully strikes an good outsider, the outsider is also subject to a <i>banishment</i>, using his antipaladin level as the caster level (his weapon and unholy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the <i>banishment</i> effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever he channels negative energy or uses touch of corruption to damage a creature, he deals the maximum possible amount.</p>",
