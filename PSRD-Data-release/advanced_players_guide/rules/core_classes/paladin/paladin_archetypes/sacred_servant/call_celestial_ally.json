    "body": "<p id=\"call-celestial-ally\">At 8th level, a sacred servant can call upon her deity for aid, in the form of a powerful servant. This allows the sacred servant to cast <i>lesser planar ally</i> once per week as a spell-like ability without having to pay the material component cost or the servant (for reasonable tasks). At 12th level, this improves to <i>planar ally</i> and at 16th level, this improves to <i>greater planar ally</i>. The sacred servant's caster level for this effect is equal to her paladin level. This ability replaces aura of resolve.</p>",
