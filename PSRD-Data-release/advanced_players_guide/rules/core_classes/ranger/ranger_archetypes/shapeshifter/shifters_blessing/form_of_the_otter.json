    "body": "<p id=\"form-of-the-otter\">The ranger's hands and feet grow webs, and his body grows an oily fur that is water resistant. While in this form, the ranger gains a swim speed of 30 feet and a +8 bonus on Swim checks. </p><p>At 8th level and again every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional form for his shifter's blessing and may use this ability one additional time per day. This is not a polymorph ability; a ranger with shifter's blessing in one of his shifted forms can be affected by a polymorph ability and retain his bonus and traits gained by the class feature. This ability replaces favored terrain.</p>",
