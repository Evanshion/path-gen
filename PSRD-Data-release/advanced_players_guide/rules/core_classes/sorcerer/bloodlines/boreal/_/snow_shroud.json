    "body": "<p id=\"snow-shroud\">At 9th level, you ignore concealment and Perception penalties in natural or magical snow, ice, fog, and similar weather conditions. In addition, you can surround yourself with a cloak of swirling snow for a number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level. This power acts and deals damage as a <i>fire shield (chill shield)</i> that sheds no light. It provides a 20% miss chance on attacks made against you and grants a bonus on Stealth checks equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level in snowy or icy areas. You can use this ability once per day at 9th level, twice per day at 17th, and three times per day at 20th.</p>",
