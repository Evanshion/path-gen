    "body": "<p id=\"dreamshaper\">At 9th level, you can manipulate the dreamscape of others, drawing forth or tampering with their subconscious minds. This power allows you to tamper with the target's memories as if using <i>modify memory</i>, or you may ask questions as if using <i>speak with dead</i> upon a corpse. A successful Will save negates the effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier, with further modifiers as the <i>nightmare</i> spell. You can use this ability once per day at 9th level. At 17th level you can use this ability twice per day, and at 20th, three times per day. </p>",
