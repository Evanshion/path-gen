As a standard action, you attempt to dominate a creature as though using the <i>dominate monster</i> spell, except that the creature must have a number of Hit Dice equal to or less than your wizard level. The targeted creature receives a Will saving throw each round to negate the effect. The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can dominate creatures for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. You must concentrate as a standard action to maintain control over a dominated creature.</p>",
