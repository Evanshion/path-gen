This healing may be spread out between the targets of the spell in any way you choose. If you assign any of the healing to an undead creature, it instead takes 1 point of damage for each point assigned. At 11th level, the amount of damage cured increases to 2 points of damage per level of the spell. This healing occurs when the spell is cast and has no effect on creatures that enter its area after the spell is in place. At 20th level, the amount of damage cured increases to 3 points of damage per level of the spell.</p>",

The recipient gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage you received (prevented damage is not counted). These temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later. You may not use this ability to grant yourself temporary hit points. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
