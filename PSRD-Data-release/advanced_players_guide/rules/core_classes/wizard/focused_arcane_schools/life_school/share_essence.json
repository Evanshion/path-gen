    "body": "<p id=\"share-essence\">As a standard action, you can share your vital energy with a living creature that you touch. You take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage + 1 for every two wizard levels you possess. You cannot take an amount of nonlethal damage equal to or greater than your current hit point total; any excess is prevented. The recipient gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage you received (prevented damage is not counted). These temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later. You may not use this ability to grant yourself temporary hit points. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier. This ability has no effect if you are immune to nonlethal damage. </p>",
