Creatures with more Hit Dice than your wizard level are unaffected, as are creatures in combat and those with an attitude of hostile toward you. Creatures receive a Will saving throw to negate the effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Creatures that fail their save are affected by <i>charm monster</i> for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). This is a mind-affecting effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.</p>",
