On command, the brooch transforms in a clatter of metallic plates and panels to instantly cover the wearer in a complete suit of <i>+1 full plate</i>, with the design of the brooch displayed on the armor's breastplate. The same command word causes the armor to transform into the brooch. The brooch only transforms if the wearer's armor slot is unoccupied, thus it won't work if the wearer is already armored.</p>",
