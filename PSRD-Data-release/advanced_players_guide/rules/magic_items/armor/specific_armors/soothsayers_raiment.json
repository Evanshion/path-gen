While wearing the armor, an oracle has access to that revelation and may use it as if she had it as a normal class feature. The oracle must have the appropriate mystery to use the armor; for example, a <i>soothsayer's raiment (battlecry)</i> is only usable by an oracle of battle. If the wearer already has that revelation and the revelation gives an ability with a limited number of uses per day, the oracle can use that ability one additional time per day. This ability has no effect if worn by a non-oracle.</p><p>For divination spells with a percentage-based chance of success (such as <i>augury</i> and <i>divination</i>), the wearer's chance increases by +5.</p>",
