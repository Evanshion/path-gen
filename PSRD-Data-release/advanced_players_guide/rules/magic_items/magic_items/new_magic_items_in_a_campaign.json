    "body": "<p>How pervasive a GM chooses to make the magic items in this chapter is entirely a matter of personal preference. There's no reason these new items need to be any rarer than those found in the <i>Core Rulebook</i>, and they can be integrated into a campaign just as easily. Alternatively, GMs interested in adding an unexpected element to their next encounter or treasure hoard might easily incorporate the properties and specific treasures presented here. As players tend to leaf through the magic item chapter of the <i>Core Rulebook</i> when outfitting their characters, many become quite familiar with the treasures and effects therein. Thus, incorporating any of the following items&mdash;especially those that draw upon features first presented elsewhere in this book, like new metamagic rods&mdash;allows a GM to surprise and intrigue even the most experienced players. </p>",
