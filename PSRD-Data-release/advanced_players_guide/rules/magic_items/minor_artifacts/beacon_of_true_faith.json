The torch holds an undying magical flame that requires no fuel or air, and in the hands of most creatures it simply functions as an everburning torch. When held by a divine spellcaster, an outsider with an alignment subtype, or a creature of especially strong religious faith (GM's discretion, but usually requiring a feat or trait reflecting this devotion), the beacon gains additional powers based on the bearer's alignment. All of these are command-word activated.</p><p>Chaotic (violet flame): <i>Word of chaos</i> once per day on command.</p><p>Good (white flame): Allies within 30 feet of the beacon gain the benefits of <i>protection from evil</i> and <i>heroism</i>.</p><p>Evil (black flame): Bearer is constantly under the effect of <i>protection from good</i> and may use <i>harm</i> twice per day.</p><p>Lawful (golden flame): <i>Dictum</i> once per day on command.</p>",
