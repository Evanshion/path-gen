For example, a paladin who strikes an undead opponent with her <i>conductive greatsword</i> can expend two uses of lay on hands ability (a supernatural melee touch attack) to deal greatsword damage and damage from one use of her lay on hands.

It can even take the shape of comparable weapons of different size categories. For example, a Small greatsword is a two-handed slashing weapon for a Small character, but is a one-handed slashing weapon for a Medium character, which is very similar to a Medium longsword; a Small <i>transformative greatsword</i> can become an actual Medium longsword, usable by a Medium creature without the &ndash;2 penalty for using a weapon of the wrong size.
