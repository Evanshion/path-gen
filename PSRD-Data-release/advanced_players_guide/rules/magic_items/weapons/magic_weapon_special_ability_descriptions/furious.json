    "body": "<p id=\"furious\">This ability can only be placed on a melee weapon. A <i>furious weapon</i> serves as a focus for its wielder's anger. When the wielder is raging or under the effect of a <i>rage</i> spell, the weapon's enhancement bonus is +2 better than normal. If the wielder has a rage power that gives a skill bonus while raging (such as raging climber, raging leaper, or raging swimmer), the wielder gains an enhancement bonus to that skill whenever the weapon is wielded or held in hand, even when not raging; this bonus is equal to the enhancement bonus of the weapon (including the +2 when the wielder is raging).</p><p>Moderate enchantment (compulsion); CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, rage; Price +1 bonus.</p>",
