A universalist wizard who selects the necklace as his bonded object (which counts as an amulet) may choose one school of spells each day when he prepares spells. He then can use the necklace to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard spell of that school into any other wizard spell of that school he knows; the desired spell must be of the same level or lower than the prepared spell. For example, if the wizard chose &ldquo;evocation&rdquo; when he prepared his spells that morning, until the next time he prepares spells, he can spontaneously convert a prepared <i>fireball</i> into any other evocation wizard spell of 3rd level or lower that he knows.</p>",
