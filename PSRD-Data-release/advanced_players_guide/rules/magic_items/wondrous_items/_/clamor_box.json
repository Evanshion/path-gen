Four command words determine what sorts of sounds it is to play (battle, fire, massacre, or riot), and a fifth determines the delay (anywhere from 1 round to 20 minutes) until the box begins to produce the desired sound. The noise from the box is as loud as 40 people. The sound persists for 2d6 rounds.</p>",
