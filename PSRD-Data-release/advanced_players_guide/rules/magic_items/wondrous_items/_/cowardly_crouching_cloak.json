Any creature seeking to directly attack him while he does this must make a DC 11 Will save to do so (as the <i>sanctuary</i> spell). The wearer cannot see or take any actions while crouching. This makes him effectively blind, with all the normal penalties, but not helpless. The wearer can end his crouch simply by standing up or moving.</p>",
