    "body": "<p id=\"basic-traits\">There are a total of 40 basic traits, which are split evenly among the categories of Combat, Faith, Magic, and Social. Note that each of these four categories roughly equates to the four modes of adventuring, but aren't tied to specific classes. It's perfectly possible to have a religious rogue, for example, or a magic-obsessed fighter. Basic traits are &ldquo;generic,&rdquo; and should be able to fit into any campaign setting with a minimum of customization.</p>",
