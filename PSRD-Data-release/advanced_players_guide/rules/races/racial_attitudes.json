    "body": "<p>The following race discussions describe the general attitudes held by each race toward the 11 base classes in the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> and the six new base classes introduced here in the <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>. Humans tend to fit easily into every class, while other races favor some occupations much more highly than others, with a handful of classes earning the contempt and suspicion of certain races. These expanded looks at racial attitudes can help give definition and depth to each race and spark ideas for how and why members of that race might be inclined to pursue one class rather than another, or what challenges they might face in adopting a career that goes against the grain of their society. </p><p>These attitudes should never be considered restrictions on what classes players may choose, regardless of their characters' race, nor are they a prescription that demands player characters think or act a certain way toward members of a class described as being highly favored (or highly disfavored) by members of their race. As always, players are the ones in charge of their own characters. These attitudes instead describe the common attitudes of typical NPC members of their race and the values and attitudes their characters may have been raised with. Characters can learn these typical attitudes about their class with a DC 10 Knowledge (local) check (DC 5 for attitudes of their own race).</p>",
