You gain a +3 competence bonus on Perception checks, a +1 competence bonus on ranged attacks, and the critical multiplier for your bows and crossbows becomes 19&ndash;20/&times;3. This effect does not stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon, such as the Improved Critical feat or a <i>keen</i> weapon.</p>",
