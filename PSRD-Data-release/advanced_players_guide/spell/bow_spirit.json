    "body": "<p>A <i>bow spirit</i> is a shapeless force that hovers about you, taking ammunition from your quiver and firing it. For as long as the <i>bow spirit</i> lasts, you can spend a swift action to direct the <i>bow spirit</i> to fire an arrow or a bolt at a target of your choice, as if the <i>bow spirit</i> were firing the necessary ranged weapon. The <i>bow spirit uses</i> your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier, as well as any bonuses and effects from feats you have that affect ranged attacks, or bonuses from the ammunition it uses. A <i>bow spirit</i>'s attacks do not provoke attacks of opportunity. There must be ammunition available for the <i>bow spirit</i> to use, and it expends ammunition as if used by you. </p><p>A <i>bow spirit</i> occupies your space, and moves with you. It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. A <i>bow spirit</i>'s AC against touch attacks is 10 + your Dexterity modifier.</p>",
