    "body": "<p>This spell functions like <i>brand</i>, except that it inflicts 1d6 points of damage when applied and cannot be removed, even temporarily. In addition, a <i>greater brand</i> blazes as bright as a torch when brought within 30 feet of a visible symbol of your faith. While the symbol is blazing, the recipient is sickened. Like the effects of <i>bestow curse</i>, a <i>greater brand</i> cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by any means that removes a <i>mark of justice</i>.</p>",
