    "body": "<p>Sharpening your perceptive abilities and tuning them against obfuscating effects, <i>hunter's eye</i> greatly enhances your senses against the target creature. You gain the ability to perceive the target when it is invisible or ethereal as though using the <i>see invisibility</i> spell, and receive a +20 competence bonus on Perception checks to locate the target. You ignore concealment provided by fog or mist, <i>blur</i>, <i>displacement</i>, <i>invisibility</i>, and similar effects affecting the target, but not concealment provided by darkness. This spell provides no benefits to your allies, and no benefits against creatures other than the target.</p>",
