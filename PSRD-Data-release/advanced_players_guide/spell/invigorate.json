    "body": "<p>This spell banishes feelings of weariness. For the duration, the subject takes no penalties from the fatigued or exhausted conditions. The effect of <i>invigorate</i> is merely an illusion, however, not a substitute for actual rest or respite. When the spell ends, the subject takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage, along with the return of the original condition(s). A creature can be under the effects of only one <i>invigorate</i> spell at a time; if it is cast a second time on that creature, the first effect immediately ends.</p>",
