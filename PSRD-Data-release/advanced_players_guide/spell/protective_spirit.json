    "body": "<p>A <i>protective spirit</i> is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that hovers about you, defending you against unexpected attacks. When a creature makes an attack of opportunity against you, the <i>protective spirit</i> makes an immediate attack using your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier. On a successful hit, the spirit does no damage, but it causes the attack of opportunity to automatically miss. A <i>protective spirit</i> can defend against a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity bonus (minimum 1) per round.</p><p>A <i>protective spirit</i> occupies your space, and moves with you. It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. A <i>protective spirit</i>'s AC against touch attacks is 10 + your Dexterity modifier.</p>",
