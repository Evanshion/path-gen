Your weapon is not harmed by this attack.</p><p>If you are using your judgment ability or smite ability against the target, it is staggered for 1 round on a successful attack. A successful Fortitude save negates the staggering effect.</p><p>On a successful critical hit, the target is stunned for 1 round and deafened for 1d6 rounds. A successful Fortitude save negates the stunning and deafening effects. If you are also using judgment or smite, your foe makes only a single save against all effects.</p><p>This spell immediately ends if your weapon leaves your hand. <i>Resounding blow</i> stacks with the <i>thundering</i> weapon property.</p>",
