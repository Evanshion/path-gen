    "body": "<p>Summoning up the power of the tempest, you direct a current of forceful winds where you please. This spell creates a 5-foot-diameter line of wind&mdash;the direction of the wind is away from your location when you cast the spell, and remains constant in that direction for the spell duration. Creatures caught in a <i>river of wind</i> take 4d6 nonlethal damage and are knocked prone. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and prevents being knocked prone.</p><p>A creature that begins its turn wholly or partially within a <i>river of wind</i> must make a Fortitude save or be pushed 20 feet in the wind's direction of flow, take 2d6 nonlethal damage, and be knocked prone&mdash;a successful Fortitude save means the creature merely takes 1d6 nonlethal damage. Creatures under the effect of <i>freedom of movement</i> and creatures with the air subtype are unaffected by a <i>river of wind</i>.</p>",
