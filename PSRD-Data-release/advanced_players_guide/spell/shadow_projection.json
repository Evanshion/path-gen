    "body": "<p>With this spell, you infuse your life force and psyche into your shadow, giving it independent life and movement as if it were an undead shadow (see <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 245). Your physical body lies comatose while you are projecting your shadow, and your body has no shadow or reflection while the spell is in effect.</p><p>While projecting your shadow, you gain a shadow's darkvision, defensive abilities, fly speed, racial stealth modifier, and strength damage attack. You do not gain the creature's <i>create spawn</i> ability, nor its skill ranks or Hit Dice. Your shadow has Hit Dice and hit points equal to your own. Your <i>shadow projection</i> has the undead type and may be turned or affected as undead.</p><p>If your <i>shadow projection</i> is slain, you return to your physical body and are immediately reduced to &ndash;1 hit points. Your condition becomes dying, and you must begin making Constitution checks to stabilize.</p>",
