    "body": "<p>An ally made of pure force appears in a single 5-foot square within range. The ally takes the form of a servant of your god. The <i>spiritual ally</i> occupies its space, though you and your allies can move through it, since it is your ally. The <i>spiritual ally</i> carries a single weapon, one favored by your deity (as for <i>spiritual weapon</i>), which has the same threat range and critical modifiers as a real weapon of its form. Each round on your turn, starting with the turn that you cast this spell, your <i>spiritual ally</i> can make an attack against a foe within its reach that you designate. The <i>spiritual ally</i> threatens adjacent squares and can flank and make attacks of opportunity as if it were a normal creature. The <i>spiritual ally</i> uses your base attack bonus (gaining extra attacks if your base attack bonus is high enough) plus your Wisdom bonus when it makes a melee attack. When the <i>spiritual ally</i> hits, it deals 1d10 points of force damage + 1 point of damage per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). It strikes as a spell, not a weapon, so it bypasses DR and can affect incorporeal creatures.</p><p>Each round after the first, you can move the <i>spiritual ally</i> as a swift action. It has a speed of 30 feet, and a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect maneuverability). Being a construct of force, the <i>spiritual ally</i> cannot be harmed by any physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. A <i>spiritual ally</i>'s AC against touch attacks is 10. </p><p>If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i>spiritual ally</i> strikes it. If the ally is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.</p>",
