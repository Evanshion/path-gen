These swarms have all their normal qualities and abilities but also bear a tiny portion of your consciousness that allows you to perceive what they do and to control their actions. While in this form, you cannot use any of your own abilities or take any actions other than controlling the swarms.</p><p>Each time you cast this spell you get a total allotment of levels equal to your caster level and any swarm you choose to create costs one or more of those levels. You can &ldquo;spend&rdquo; your allotment of levels to create any combination of swarms so long as their total does not exceed your caster level. </p>",
