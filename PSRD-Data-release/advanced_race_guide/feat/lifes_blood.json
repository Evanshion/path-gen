When using this feat, you take 1d4 points of damage and apply your blood to the wounds of a living creature, healing it for a number of hit points equal to the amount of damage you took from the ritual. This is a supernatural ability. Only you can perform this bloodletting. A creature cannot be healed by this ability more than once per day.</p>",
