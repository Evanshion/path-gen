The belt allows a creature to wear a magic ring on each foot in addition to the ring on each hand, though only two rings function at any given time. As a swift action, the wearer can change which of his rings are active (both hands, both feet, left hand and right foot, and so on). For example, a creature could wear a <i>ring of protection</i>, <i>ring of energy resistance</i>, <i>ring of swimming</i>, and <i>ring of counterspells</i>, switching between any two of them as a swift action each round as it desires.</p><p>The belt does not change the type of action required to activate a ring (for example, activating a <i>ring of invisibility</i> is still a standard action), but allows the wearer to easily switch between the constant powers of several worn rings. While the belt is worn, wearing a ring on a foot counts toward the attunement process of certain rings (such as a <i>ring of sustenance</i>) even if the belt isn't used to make that ring active during that attunement period. </p>",
