    "body": "<p id=\"brewed-reek\">Animal musk, spoiled meat, pungent plants, and any other foul-smelling substances on hand go into a batch of brewed reek. When boiled, this mixture becomes a thick alchemical slime that adheres to anything it touches. You can hurl brewed reek as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. A creature struck with a direct hit must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 2d6 rounds. If the target fails its save, it must make a second Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. Creatures in the splash area must make a Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. A creature that drinks brewed reek does not get a saving throw and is sickened for 2d6 rounds and nauseated for 1 round. </p>",
