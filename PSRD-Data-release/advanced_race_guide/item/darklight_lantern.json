    "body": "<p id=\"darklight-lantern\">This lantern does not burn oil, but instead burns shadowcloy (see below). When shadowcloy is used as its fuel, this lantern creates a strange, hazy darkness that decreases the light level for 30 feet around it by one step . Unlike when shadowcloy is thrown at a single target, this haze does not decrease natural  darkness to supernatural darkness. One flask of shadowcloy fuels a darklight lantern for 1 minute. </p>",
