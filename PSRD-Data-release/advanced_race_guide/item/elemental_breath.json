    "body": "<p id=\"elemental-breath\">This vial at first seems to be empty, but when it's opened, a rush of wind issues forth from within. When elemental breath is inhaled (as drinking a potion) by an air-breathing creature, that creature does not need to breath air for 10 rounds. A vial of elemental breath must be inhaled on the round it was opened to gain this effect. If it is not, the item is wasted. </p>",
