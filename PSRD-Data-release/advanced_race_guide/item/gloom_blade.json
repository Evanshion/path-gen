In darkness, it acts as <i>+2 short sword</i>. When surrounded by supernatural darkness, such as in an area of <i>deeper darkness</i>, it acts a <i>+2 short sword</i> and bestows the benefit of the Blind-Fight feat to its wielder. In daylight or bright illumination, the sword temporarily loses all its magical enhancement bonuses and acts as a masterwork weapon, though it resumes its magical functions once it is no longer in the bright light.</p>",
