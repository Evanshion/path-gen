    "body": "<p id=\"hobgoblin-war-draught\">This drink is a foul-smelling alchemical blend of raw alcohol, mashed grubs, and medicinal mushrooms. A hobgoblin under the effects of hobgoblin war draught ignores all penalties resulting from the fatigued and shaken conditions for 10 minutes, after which he must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 hour. Anyone lacking the goblinoid subtype who drinks hobgoblin war draught must immediately make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 hour; success means the drinker ignores all penalties resulting from the fatigued and shaken conditions for 1 minute, after which he is sickened for 10 minutes. Hobgoblin war draught has no effect on creatures that are immune to poison.</p>",
