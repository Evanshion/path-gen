For most creatures, this grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Perception checks for 1 hour. For gnomes, it briefly grants a super-heightened sense of smell, granting the scent ability for 5 minutes, before the potency is reduced to a +2 circumstance bonus on Perception checks for an additional 1 hour.</p>",
