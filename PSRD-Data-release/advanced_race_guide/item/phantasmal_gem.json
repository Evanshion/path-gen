If a spellcaster holding the <i>phantasmal gem</i> casts an illusion spell with a duration of concentration (or concentration + a number of rounds), the illusion lasts up to an additional 10 rounds after the spellcaster ceases concentrating on it. The spellcaster may end the illusion early as a swift action. The <i>phantasmal gem</i> can be used multiple times in a day, but cannot grant more than a total of 10 additional rounds of illusion spells per day. A gnome using a <i>phantasmal gem</i> can recharge it by expending uses of spell-like abilities gained through the gnome magic racial trait. Each spell-like ability expended as a standard action recharges 1 round of duration to the <i>phantasmal gem</i> (up to a maximum of 10 rounds).</p>",
