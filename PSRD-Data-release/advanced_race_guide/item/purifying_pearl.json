First, up to 10 cubic feet of food or drink that it touches per day is affected as if a <i>purify food and drink</i> spell had been cast upon the food or drink. Second, once per day, if placed in the mouth of a creature (as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity), the pearl acts as a <i>neutralize poison</i> spell cast on that creature (caster level 10th).</p>",
