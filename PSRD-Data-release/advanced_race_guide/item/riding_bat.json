    "body": "<p id=\"riding-bat\">Considered to be the fastest nonmagical transport in the Darklands, dire bats (<i>Bestiary</i> 30) are domesticated in captivity to serve as riding animals. Stables that accommodate these massive creatures are only commonly found in drow cities built in larger underground caverns, owing to the greater space required for training and exercise, though some drow outriders fly them almost to the surface. These creatures require exotic saddles to ride.</p>",
