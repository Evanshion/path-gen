This attack deals 1d4 points of piercing damage for a Medium wearer or 1d3 points of damage for a Small wearer. After about a week of wearing the ring, the wearer's appearance becomes more ratlike, though she still looks like a member of her original race (for example, a human might gain prominent teeth).</p>",
