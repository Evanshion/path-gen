Often worn on the little finger, the ring grants its wearer a +4 competence bonus on Sense Motive and Knowledge (local) checks. Also, once per day on command, the wearer can use the ring to cast either <i>locate creature</i> or <i>locate object</i> (the wearer's choice). Furthermore, on command and at will, the wearer can instantly know the direction from her to the nearest tavern, pub, or similar watering hole as long as that establishment is in a settlement whose population is equivalent to that of a village or greater and which is within 20 miles of the wearer.</p>",
