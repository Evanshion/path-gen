    "body": "<p id=\"roar-cord\">This thin length of rope has many oddly shaped bits of hollow metal fixed along its length. As a standard action, a creature can swing a roar cord over its head to generate a variety of eerie noises. For the next round, any creature within 60 feet of the roar cord takes a &ndash;2 penalty on Perception checks that rely on sound and a &ndash;1 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. The roar cord can be used as a bardic instrument (string instrument) that grants the bard a +2 bonus on Perform checks when using the countersong bardic performance.</p>",
