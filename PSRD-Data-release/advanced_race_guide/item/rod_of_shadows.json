The rod functions as a <i>+2 light mace</i>, and allows its wielder to see in darkness as if it had the see in darkness ability. Three times per day, the wielder can use it to create a <i>deeper darkness</i> effect (caster level 8th). To use this ability, the rod's wielder must touch the object affected, which is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>",
