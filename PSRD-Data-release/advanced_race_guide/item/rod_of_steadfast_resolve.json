While a creature wields this rod, it grants all its allies within a 20-foot-radius burst a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and emotion effects, or a +4 morale bonus on such saves if the ally has the human subtype. </p><p>Also, once per day as an immediate action, the wielder can activate the rod to allow himself or a single ally within the rod's aura to reroll a failed saving throw against a spell or effect with the fear or emotion descriptor. The affected creature must take the result of the reroll, even if it is worse. </p>",
