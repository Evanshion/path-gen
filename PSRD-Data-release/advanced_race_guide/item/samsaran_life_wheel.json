Inscribed upon the exterior of the spool are dozens of samsaran prayers along with names or symbols associated with a samsaran's past lives. Samsarans believe that spinning the wheel during meditation strengthens the spiritual connections between their former lives. If a samsaran meditates with her wheel for at least 10 minutes about a Knowledge (history) question relating to her own history or the histories of her past lives, she gains a +1 insight bonus on the check.</p>",
