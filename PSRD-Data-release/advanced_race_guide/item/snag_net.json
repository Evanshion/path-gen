    "body": "<p id=\"snag-net\">This short, wide net is covered in barbed loops and slipknots. It works like a typical net exotic weapon, except it has the trip weapon special feature. If you entangle an opponent and hold the trailing rope, on your turn in place of a melee attack you may make a trip combat maneuver check against that opponent; if you succeed, you may trip the opponent or deal 1 point of piercing damage to the opponent. The concentration DC  to cast while entangled in a snag net is 17 + the spell's level. The Escape Artist DC to escape a snag net is 22.</p>",
