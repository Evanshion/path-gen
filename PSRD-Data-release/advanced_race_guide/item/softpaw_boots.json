    "body": "<p id=\"softpaw-boots\">These soft and subtle boots are constructed of silk and specially cured leather. They are specially designed for catfolk feet. They work with the feline structure of the race's feet to soften footfalls and to reduce the imprints of their tracks. While wearing softpaw boots, a catfolk gains a +1 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks. Furthermore, the DC to notice or follow the tracks of a catfolk wearing softpaw boots increases by +2. </p>",
