A vanara's body is covered in a thin coat of soft fur, and individuals with chestnut, ivory, and even golden coats are common. Despite their fur, vanaras can grow lengthy hair on their head just as humans can, and both male and female vanaras take pains to wear elaborate hairstyles for important social functions. The hair on a vanara's head matches the color of its fur. All vanaras have long, prehensile tails and handlike feet capable of well-articulated movements. A vanara stands slightly shorter and weighs slightly less than a typical human.  </p>",

For example, a creature could wear a <i>ring of protection</i>, <i>ring of energy resistance</i>, <i>ring of swimming</i>, and <i>ring of counterspells</i>, switching between any two of them as a swift action each round as it desires.</p><p>The belt does not change the type of action required to activate a ring (for example, activating a <i>ring of invisibility</i> is still a standard action), but allows the wearer to easily switch between the constant powers of several worn rings. While the belt is worn, wearing a ring on a foot counts toward the attunement process of certain rings (such as a <i>ring of sustenance</i>) even if the belt isn't used to make that ring active during that attunement period. </p>",
