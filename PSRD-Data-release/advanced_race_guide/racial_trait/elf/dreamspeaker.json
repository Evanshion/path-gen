    "body": "<p id=\"dreamspeaker\">A few elves have the ability to tap into the power of sleep, dreams, and prescient reverie. Elves with this racial trait add +1 to the saving throw DCs of spells of the divination school and sleep effects they cast. In addition, elves with Charisma scores of 15 or higher may use <i>dream</i> once per day as a spell-like ability (caster level is equal to the elf's character level). This racial trait replaces elven immunities.</p>",
