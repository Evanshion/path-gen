As a result, some are trained in minor magics that are particularly useful when dealing with non-elves. Elves with this racial trait and an Intelligence score of 11 or higher gain the following spell-like abilities once per day: <i>comprehend languages</i>,<i> detect magic</i>,<i> detect poison</i>, and<i> read magic</i>. The caster level for these effects is equal to the elf's level. This racial trait replaces elven magic.</p>",
