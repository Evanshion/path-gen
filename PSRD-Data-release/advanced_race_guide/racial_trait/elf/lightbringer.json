    "body": "<p id=\"lightbringer\">Many elves revere the sun, moon, and stars, but some are literally infused with the radiant power of the heavens. Elves with this racial trait are immune to light-based blindness and dazzle effects, and are treated as one level higher when determining the effects of any light-based spell or effect they cast (including spell-like and supernatural abilities). Elves with Intelligence scores of 10 or higher may use <i>light</i> at will as a spell-like ability. This racial trait replaces the elven immunities and elven magic racial traits.</p>",
