    "body": "<p id=\"gloom-shimmer\">Some fetchlings can manipulate shadowy energy in order to displace their location instead of transporting between shadows. Upon reaching 9th level, instead of gaining <i>shadow walk</i> as a spell-like ability, these fetchlings gain <i>displacement</i> as a spell-like ability usable twice per day. For this ability, a fetchling's caster level is equal to his total Hit Dice. This racial trait modifies the spell-like ability racial trait.  </p>",
