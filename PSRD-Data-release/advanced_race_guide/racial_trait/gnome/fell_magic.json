Gnomes with Wisdom scores of 11 or higher also gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day&mdash;<i>bleed</i>,<i> chill touch</i>,<i> detect poison</i>, and<i> touch of fatigue</i>. The caster level for these effects is equal to the gnome's level. The DC for these spells is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the gnome's Wisdom modifier. This racial trait replaces gnome magic.</p>",
