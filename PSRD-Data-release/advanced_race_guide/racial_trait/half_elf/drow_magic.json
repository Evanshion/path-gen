Half-elves with this trait have drow blood somewhere in their background, and can cast <i>dancing lights</i>, <i>darkness</i>, and <i>faerie fire</i> each once per day, using the half-elf's character level as the caster level for these spell-like abilities. This racial trait replaces the adaptability and multitalented racial traits. </p>",
