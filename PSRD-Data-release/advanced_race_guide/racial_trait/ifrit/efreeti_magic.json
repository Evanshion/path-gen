    "body": "<p id=\"efreeti-magic\">Some ifrits inherit an efreeti ancestor's ability to magically change a creature's size. They can cast either <i>enlarge person</i> or <i>reduce person</i> (the ifrit chooses when using this ability) once per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equals the ifrit's level). The ifrit can use this ability to affect other ifrits as though they were humanoid creatures. This racial trait replaces the spell-like ability racial trait.</p>",
