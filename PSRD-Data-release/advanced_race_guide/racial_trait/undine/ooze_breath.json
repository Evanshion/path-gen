    "body": "<p id=\"ooze-breath\">Some undines' outsider heritage can be traced to ooze mephits. These undines have a breath weapon that is a 5-foot cone of slime usable once per day. The slime deals 1d4 points of acid damage per two character levels (maximum 5d4) and sickens creatures in the area for 3 rounds. A successful Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the undine's level + the undine's Constitution modifier) halves the damage and negates the sickened effect. This racial trait replaces the spell-like ability racial trait.</p>",
