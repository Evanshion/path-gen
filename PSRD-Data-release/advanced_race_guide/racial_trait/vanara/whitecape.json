    "body": "<p id=\"whitecape\">The rare whitecape vanara clans have more in common with savanna-dwelling baboons than the jungle-dwelling monkeys that most vanaras resemble.  Their stooping build grants them a +4 racial bonus to CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip. These vanaras usually have a thick mane of hair on the head and shoulders (called a \"cape\") and shorter tails. This racial trait replaces prehensile tail.</p>",
