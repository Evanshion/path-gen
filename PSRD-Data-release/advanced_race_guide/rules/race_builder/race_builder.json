    "body": "<p>There comes a point in nearly every campaign when someone&mdash;either one of the players or the GM&mdash;wants to create a new race. Sometimes the GM needs a new race to fill a story or ecological niche in her campaign world. Such races may be as simple as elves who dwell in an arctic climate or as complex as clockwork giants from another plane of existence. Perhaps a player wants to play a monstrous race, or has been inspired by some piece of fiction or flight of creative fancy and wants to create a race for a new character concept not yet seen in Pathfinder. The following rules allow GMs, or even players with GM oversight, to create new races that are balanced and mesh with the core races.</p><p>In addition, these rules allow you to create powerful races meant to take on more challenging encounters than those typically faced by the core races. You can create new races, model a race after an existing monster, or even \"power up\" core races in order to play those races side-by-side with more powerful new races.</p>",
