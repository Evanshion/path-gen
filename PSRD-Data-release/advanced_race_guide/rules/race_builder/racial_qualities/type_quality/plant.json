Note that regular plants, such as those found in ordinary gardens and fields, lack Wisdom and Charisma scores and are not creatures, but objects, even though they are alive. A plant race has the following features. </p><ul><li>Plants have the low-light vision racial trait. </li><li>Plants are immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms). </li><li>Plants are immune to paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep effects, and stunning. </li><li>Plants breathe and eat, but do not sleep, unless they want to gain some beneficial effect from this activity. This means that a plant creature can sleep in order to regain spells, but sleep is not required to survive or stay in good health.</li></ul>",
