    "body": "<p id=\"breeze-kissed-(4-rp)\"><i>Prerequisite</i>: Outsider (native) with ties to the Plane of Air or fey type; <i>Benefit</i>: Members of this race are surrounded by swirling winds, gaining a +2 racial bonus to AC against nonmagical ranged attacks. They can calm or renew these winds as a swift action. Once per day, a member of this race can channel this wind into a single gust, making a bull rush or trip combat maneuver attempt against one creature within 30 feet. Doing so exhausts the user's breeze-kissed ability for 24 hours. This is a supernatural ability.</p>",
