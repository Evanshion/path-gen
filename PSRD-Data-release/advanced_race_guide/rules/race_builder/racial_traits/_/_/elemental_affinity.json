    "body": "<p id=\"elemental-affinity-(1-rp)\"><i>Prerequisite</i>: Outsider (native) with ties to an elemental plane; <i>Benefit</i>: If a member of the race is a sorcerer with the elemental bloodline corresponding to the elemental plane it has ties to (i.e., air, earth, fire, or water), it treats its Charisma score as 2 points higher for all sorcerer spells and class abilities. Furthermore, a member of this race able to cast domain spells that correspond to the elemental plane the race has ties to casts its domain powers and spells at +1 caster level. This trait does not give members of this race early access to level-based powers; it only affects powers that they could already use without this trait.</p>",
