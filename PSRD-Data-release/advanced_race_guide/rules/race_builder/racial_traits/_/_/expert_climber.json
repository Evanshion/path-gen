    "body": "<p id=\"expert-climber-(4-rp)\"><i>Prerequisite</i>: Climb racial trait; <i>Benefit</i>: Members of this race can cling to cave walls and even ceilings as long as the surface has hand- and footholds. In effect, members of this race are treated as being constantly under the effects of a nonmagical <i>spider climb</i> spell, save that members of this race cannot cling to smooth surfaces. This trait doubles the normal +8 racial bonus on Climb checks normally granted to creatures with a climb speed (to a total +16 bonus). </p>",
