    "body": "<p id=\"fast-healing-(6-rp)\"><i>Prerequisites</i>: None; <i>Benefit</i>: Members of this race regain 1 hit point each round. Except for where noted here, fast healing is just like natural healing. Fast healing does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow a creature to regrow lost body parts. Fast healing continues to function (even at negative hit points) until a member of this race dies, at which point the effects of fast healing immediately end. <i>Special</i>: This trait can be taken multiple times. Each time fast healing is taken, its cost increases by 1 RP. </p>",
