    "body": "<p id=\"fertile-soil-(2-rp)\"><i>Prerequisite</i>: Outsider (native) with ties to the Plane of Earth, fey type, or plant type; <i>Benefit</i>: Sorcerer members of this race with the verdant bloodline treat their Charisma score as 2 points higher for all sorcerer spells and class abilities. Clerics who are members of this race with the Plant domain use their domain powers and spells at +1 caster level. This trait does not give members of this race early access to level-based powers; it only affects powers that they could already use without this trait.</p>",
