    "body": "<p id=\"gliding-wings-(3-rp)\"><i>Prerequisites</i>: None; <i>Benefit</i>: Members of this race take no damage from falling (as if subject to a constant nonmagical <i>feather fall</i> spell). While in midair, members of this race can move up to 5 feet in any horizontal direction for every 1 foot they fall, at a speed of 60 feet per round. A member of a race with gliding wings cannot gain height with these wings alone; it merely coasts in other directions as it falls. If subjected to a strong wind or any other effect that causes a creature with gliding wings to rise, it can take advantage of the updraft to increase the distance it can glide.</p>",
