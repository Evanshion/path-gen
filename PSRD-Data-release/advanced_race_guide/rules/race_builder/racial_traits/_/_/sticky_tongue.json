    "body": "<p id=\"sticky-tongue-(2-rp)\"><i>Prerequisite</i>: Medium or larger size; <i>Benefit</i>: Members of this race can make melee attacks with their long, sticky tongues. This is a secondary attack. A creature hit by this attack cannot move more than 10 feet away from the attacker and takes a &ndash;2 penalty to AC as long as the tongue is attached (this penalty does not stack if multiple tongues are attached). The tongue can be removed by the target or an adjacent ally by making an opposed Strength check against the attacking creature as a standard action or by dealing 2 points of damage to the tongue (AC 11, damage does not reduce the sticky-tongued creature's hit points). A member of this race cannot move more than 10 feet away from a creature stuck to its tongue, but it can release its tongue from the target as a free action. A member of this race can only have one creature attached to its tongue at a time. <i>Special</i>: This trait can be taken up to two times. The second time it is taken, members of this race gain the ability to pull a creature attached to their tongue 5 feet toward them as a swift action.</p>",
