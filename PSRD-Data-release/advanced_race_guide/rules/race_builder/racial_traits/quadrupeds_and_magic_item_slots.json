The best way to deal with this is to create variant magic item versions of the various boots, shoes, and slippers that can be worn by this race. Allow members of these races to find <i>ankle bracelets of speed</i> or <i>horseshoes of spider climb</i> that act just like their traditional magic item counterparts, but fit the new race's form.</p>",
