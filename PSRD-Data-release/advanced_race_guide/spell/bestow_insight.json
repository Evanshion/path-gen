    "body": "<p>When casting this spell, choose a single skill that you have at least one rank in. The target gains a +2 insight bonus on skill checks with this skill and is considered trained in that skill. The insight bonus increases by 1 for every four levels of the caster (maximum +6). Furthermore, once before the spell's duration, the target can choose to roll two checks and take the greater result. Doing so ends the spell's other effects.</p>",
