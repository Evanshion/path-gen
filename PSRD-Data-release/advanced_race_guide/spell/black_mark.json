    "body": "<p>You mark the target with a black marking on its skin; the mark's exact appearance determined by you, but can be no larger than your hand. The <i>black mark</i> functions as a <i>mark of justice</i>, and when the mark is activated, the target becomes shaken anytime it is on or in the water more than a 5 feet from shore. In addition, as long as the <i>black mark</i> is active, the target is affected as if subject to <i>nature's exile</i> , but all creatures with the aquatic or water subtype or with a swim speed are made hostile, even those not of the animal type, though non-aquatic animals are not. </p>",
