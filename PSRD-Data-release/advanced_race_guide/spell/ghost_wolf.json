    "body": "<p>This spell conjures a Large, quasi-real, wolflike creature made of roiling black smoke. It functions as <i>phantom steed</i>, except as noted above. In addition, the creature radiates an aura of fear. Any creature with fewer than 6 Hit Dice within 30 feet (except the ghost wolf\u2018s rider) must make a Will save or become shaken for 1d4 rounds (this is a mind-affecting fear effect). A creature that makes its Will save is unaffected by the steed's fear aura for 24 hours.</p><p>The ghost wolf may also be used in combat. Once per round, the rider may direct the ghost wolf to attack in battle as a free action (bite +10, 1d8+6 points of damage); unlike an animal mount, this does not require a Ride check or any training. Once the ghost wolf attacks, it lasts for only 1 round per level thereafter.</p>",
