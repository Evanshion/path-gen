Perpetually ill-tempered, a froghemoth often seems to kill simply for the sake of killing&mdash;vomiting up partially digested meals in favor of new prey when it encounters such. It's not unheard of to find these strange creatures far from their normal habitations, as if the marsh didn't agree with them and sent them wandering in search of a new home. Some sages argue that the froghemoth isn't from this world at all, and that these wanderings are instinctual urges to seek out its true home&mdash;a home not represented by the strange world in which the beast finds itself trapped.</p>",
