The iron cobra is typically used as a bodyguard or guardian of treasure, though its magical ability to unerringly locate creatures means it is also used as an assassin. Since an iron cobra's poison reservoir can contain multiple types of venom, the construct's specific use can be further tailored by varying the poison used. Some spellcasters even fill these reservoirs with potions, so that when the cobra bites, it injects the potion into its target. This is a somewhat dangerous method for gaining the effects of a potion, but it does free up the cobra's master to do other things in a combat round apart from quaffing potions.</p>",
