Doing so is a free action as long as the pixie is the one who fires the arrow. A pixie can generate a number of uses of dust equal to its Charisma score each day (16 uses per day for most pixies)&mdash;the dust is useless to another creature unless the pixie gives the dust freely. In this case, the pixie chooses what effect the dust will have on an arrow when it is applied, and it takes a standard action to apply the dust to the arrow. Once pixie dust is applied to an arrow, the pixie's chosen effect persists on the arrow for only 1 round. As long as an arrow is altered in this way, it does not inflict damage when it hits&mdash;it only causes its new effect. A pixie can choose any one of the following three effects when dusting an arrow. Save DCs are Charisma-based.<p class=\"stat-block-2\"><i>Charm</i>: The target must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or be affected as though by a <i>charm monster</i> spell for 10 minutes.</p><p class=\"stat-block-2\"><i>Memory Loss</i>: The target must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or be affected by a <i>modify memory</i> spell (this effect can only eliminate the previous 5 minutes of memory&mdash;a pixie typically uses this ability to make the target forget it encountered the pixie so it won't chase the pixie when he flees).</p><p class=\"stat-block-2\"><i>Sleep</i>: The target must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or fall asleep for 5 minutes.</p>",

Alternatively, you can change the types of effects that pixie dust can have on arrows&mdash;as a general rule, these alternate effects should be mind-affecting effects. <i>Confusion</i>, <i>fear</i>, <i>hideous laughter</i>, and <i>hypnotism</i> are all good choices for variant pixie arrow powers.
