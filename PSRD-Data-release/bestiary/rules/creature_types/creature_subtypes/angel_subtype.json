Otherwise, it functions as a <i>magic circle against evil</i> effect and a <i>lesser globe of invulnerability</i>, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals angel's HD). The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an angel's stat block.</li><li> <i>Truespeech (Su)</i> All angels can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a <i>tongues</i> spell (caster level equal to angel's Hit Dice). This ability is always active.</li></ul>",
