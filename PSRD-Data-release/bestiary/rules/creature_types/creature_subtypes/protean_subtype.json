    "body": "<p id=\"protean-subtype\">Proteans are serpentine outsiders of pure chaos. They have the following traits.</p><ul><li>\tBlindsense (distance varies by protean type).</li><li>\tImmunity to acid.</li><li>\tResistance to electricity 10 and sonic 10.</li><li>\tConstrict and grab as special attacks.</li><li>\tSupernatural flight.</li><li> <i>Freedom of Movement (Su)</i> A protean has continuous <i>freedom of movement</i>, as per the spell.</li><li> <i>Amorphous Anatomy (Ex)</i> A protean's vital organs shift and change shape and position constantly. This grants it a 50% chance to ignore additional damage caused by critical hits and sneak attacks, and grants it immunity to polymorph effects (unless the protean is a willing target). A protean automatically recovers from physical blindness or deafness after 1 round by growing new sensory organs to replace those that were compromised.</li><li> <i>Change Shape (Su)</i> A protean's form is not fixed. Once per day as a standard action, a protean may change shape into any Small, Medium, or Large animal, elemental, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, plant, or vermin. A protean can resume its true form as a free action, and when it does so, it gains the effects of a <i>heal</i> spell (CL equal to the protean's HD).</li></ul>",
