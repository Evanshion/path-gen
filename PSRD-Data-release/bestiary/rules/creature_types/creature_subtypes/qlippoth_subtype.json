They have the  following traits.</p><ul><li>\tImmunity to cold, mind-affecting effects, and poison.</li><li>\tResistance to acid 10, electricity 10, and fire 10.</li><li> <i>Horrific Appearance (Su)</i> All qlippoth have such horrific and mind-rending shapes that those who gaze upon them suffer all manner of ill effects. A qlippoth can present itself as a standard action to assault the senses of all living creatures within 30 feet. The exact effects caused by a qlippoth's horrific appearance vary by the type of qlippoth. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the qlippoth's Hit Dice + the qlippoth's Charisma modifier) reduces or negates the effect. This ability is a mind-affecting gaze attack.</li><li>\tTelepathy.</li><li>\tExcept where otherwise noted, qlippoth speak Abyssal.</li></ul>",
