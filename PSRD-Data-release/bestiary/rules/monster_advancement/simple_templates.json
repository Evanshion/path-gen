The &ldquo;quick rules&rdquo; present a fast way to modify die rolls made in play to simulate the template's effects without actually rebuilding the stat block&mdash;this method works well for summoned creatures. The &ldquo;rebuild rules&rdquo; list the exact changes you make to the base stat block if you have the time to completely rebuild it&mdash;this method works best when you have time during game preparation to build full stat blocks. The two methods result in creatures of similar, if not identical, abilities. In some cases, a complete rebuild does unusual things to a creature. For example, the advanced creature template gives and animal too much Intelligence, and a young incorporeal creature is tougher than a normal one.</p>",
