Others, like the ghost template, are the result of an external force acting upon a creature (for example, when a tormented person dies and becomes a ghost). Yet in both cases, the template changed a creature well after its birth or creation&mdash;these types are called &ldquo;acquired templates,&rdquo; and can be added to a creature at any time during its existance.</p>",
