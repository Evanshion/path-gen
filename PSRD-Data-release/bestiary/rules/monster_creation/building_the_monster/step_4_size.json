    "body": "<p>Now that you have the creature's average statistics, it's time to pick its size. Most creatures range in size from Small to Huge, but other sizes are not uncommon. A creature's size sets a baseline for its physical ability scores and its natural weapon damage (as noted in the Natural Attacks description in the Universal Monster Rules&mdash;see Appendix 3, pages 297&ndash;306). You should pick a size that fits well with the creature's intended role in the game and Challenge Rating. If you decide to give a creature an unusual size for its CR or HD, you should justify the unusual choice in the monster's description to account for the discrepancy&mdash;in most cases, such unusually sized monsters should be highly magical in nature. See Table: Size for more information on creature sizes and expected scores.</p>",
