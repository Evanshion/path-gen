    "body": "<p>Once you have determined a creature's size, type, and Hit Dice, it's time to move on to its ability scores. The bonuses granted from these ability scores should increase a creature's hit points, attack bonuses, and saving throws to the approximate values presented on Table: Monster Statistics by CR.</p><p>A creature's physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution) should be relatively close to the base values presented on Table: Size, depending on its size. Creatures with a few Hit Dice but a high average hit point total should have a higher than normal Constitution.</p><p>A creature's mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) are largely defined by the creature's concept. The base for all of these abilities is 10. Creatures that rely on spells and spell-like abilities in combat should have one mental ability score that stands out (usually Charisma). Creatures incapable of speech have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower. Unintelligent undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and vermin rarely have an Intelligence score.</p>",
