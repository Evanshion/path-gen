    "body": "<p id=\"push-(ex)-\">A creature with the push ability can choose to make a free combat maneuver check with a particular successful attack (often a slam attack). If successful, this check pushes an opponent directly away as with a bull rush, but the distance moved is set by this ability. The type of attack that causes the push and the distance pushed are included in the creature's description. This ability only works on creatures of a size equal to or smaller than the pushing creature. Creatures pushed in this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity and stop if the push would move them into a solid object or creature.</p>",
