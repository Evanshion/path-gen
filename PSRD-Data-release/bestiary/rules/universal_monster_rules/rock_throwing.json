    "body": "<p id=\"rock-throwing-(ex) \">This creature is an accomplished rock thrower and has a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with thrown rocks. The creature can hurl rocks up to two categories smaller than its size; for example, a Large hill giant can hurl Small rocks. A &ldquo;rock&rdquo; is any large, bulky, and relatively regularly shaped object made of any material with a hardness of at least 5. The creature can hurl the rock up to five range increments. The size of the range increment varies with the creature. Damage from a thrown rock is generally twice the creature's base slam damage plus 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus.</p>",
