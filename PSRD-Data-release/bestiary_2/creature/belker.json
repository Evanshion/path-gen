If the target moves, the belker may automatically move with the target (this movement does not count toward the belker's movement and does not provoke attacks of opportunity against the belker). Each round, the target can attempt another DC 17 Fortitude to cough out the belker's smoke, which ends the smoke claws attack and forces the belker into an adjacent square. Creatures that do not need to breathe are immune to this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
