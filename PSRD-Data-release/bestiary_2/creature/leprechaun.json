They often steal something of worth from adventurers just to provoke a chase. Using their ability to disappear at will to its full potential, they wait until their victims appear to be about to give up the chase before reappearing once more to let the chase resume. They are not greedy creatures, and eventually drop what they've stolen, slipping away while their angry pursuers claim the lost property. The exception is gold&mdash;leprechauns love gold and often hoard it in secret, hidden places. It is rumored that a person who finds a gold coin in the forest and returns it to the leprechaun that dropped it will be granted a <i>wish</i> as a reward. Unfortunately, these rumors are false&mdash;likely perpetuated by the leprechauns themselves in order to trick others into bringing them gold.</p>",
