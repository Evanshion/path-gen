If it only consumes nightmares, the target creature is immune to the effects of the nightmare spell, the dream haunting ability of the night hag, and other similar attacks for that period of sleep. If the baku instead feeds on all of the creature's dreams, that creature is fatigued upon waking and does not gain any benefits it would have received from sleep, such as natural healing or the ability to regain spells after resting.
