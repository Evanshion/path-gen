Upon realizing their mistake, the gods split the grootslang into separate creatures and thus created the first elephants and the first snakes. But one of the original grootslangs escaped, and from this first sire all other grootslangs were born. Scholars debate the veracity of such stories, and have looked to either biological or magical explanations of the creature's origins, but nevertheless bards and sages alike agree that the grootslang's fearsome reputation is well deserved.</p>",
