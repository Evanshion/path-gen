If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a living victim, it can neutralize the effects of its own poison and control the victim's movement and actions as if using dominate monster. Hellwasps quickly consume a living victim, dealing 2d4 points of Constitution damage per hour.</p><p>A hellwasp-inhabited creature is easy to spot, since its skin crawls with the forms of the insects inside.
