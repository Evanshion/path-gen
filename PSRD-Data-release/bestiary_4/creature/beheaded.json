Each beheaded created requires two onyx gems worth 100 gp and the casting of one <i>air walk</i> or <i>fly</i> spell. Beheaded can be created with additional abilities from the list below. Creating a variant beheaded counts as 1 additional Hit Die toward the caster's maximum Hit Dice of controlled undead. For every two abilities added, increase the beheaded's CR by 1.</p><p><i>Belching </i>The beheaded can make a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 30 feet that deals 1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire, chosen at the time of creation).</p><p><i>Flaming (Su)</i>The beheaded gains fire immunity and a +2 bonus to Charisma. Its slam attack also deals 1d6 points of fire damage and might catch the target on fire.</p><p><i>Grabbing (Ex)</i>This type of beheaded has long tendrils of ragged hair or other limblike growths (such as a medusa's snake hair). Its slam attack gains the grab (Medium) special ability.</p><p><i>Screaming (Su)</i>This type of beheaded can scream out once every 1d4 rounds. Every creature within 30 feet must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the screaming skull's racial Hit Dice + the screaming skull's Charisma modifier. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, any creature in the area can't be affected by that beheaded's scream for the next 24 hours.</p><p><i>Swarming (Ex)</i>The beheaded gains 1 additional Hit Die, the swarm subtype, swarm immunities, and the distraction special ability. It loses its slam attack but gains a swarm attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. This counts as two abilities for the purpose of determining the beheaded's CR.</p>",
