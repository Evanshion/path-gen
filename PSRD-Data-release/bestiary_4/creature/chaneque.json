If the victim fails the saving throw, the skull temporarily devours her soul, leaving her vulnerable to the commands of whoever holds the skull. Thereafter, the skull's possessor can use it to command the victim, as the dominate person spell. The soul remains stolen until the possessor chooses to release the victim or the skull is destroyed.
