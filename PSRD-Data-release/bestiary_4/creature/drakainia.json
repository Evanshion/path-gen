Alternatively, as a full-round action another creature can attempt to cut out the growing monster with a DC 38 Heal check.

On failed check, the pregnant creature takes 2d6 points of bleed damage and is stunned for 1 round, but the offspring is not removed. The creature spawned by means of this impregnation is any creature of the drakainia's choice that is at least one size category smaller than the creature she impregnated.
