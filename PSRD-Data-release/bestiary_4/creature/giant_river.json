Their hair color is much less varied, usually a sooty black or muddy brown color. River giants can live to be 300 years old.</p>",

Whether kind or cruel, all river giants are quick to anger and capable of erupting with little or no cause.

Good river giants typically switch between bouts of great, jovial laughter or physical comedy (such as nearly tipping a raft with passengers), followed by quiet introspection while listening to the sounds of a slow river. Evil river giants often see themselves as the embodiment of a river's most chaotic elements, like waterfalls, rapids, or ice floes; they might hold someone underwater for a minute or two as a bit of fun, and they take no more responsibility for their violence than the river itself would.</p>",
