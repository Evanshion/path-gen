All creatures within the area are deafened for as long as they remain in the area and must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be confused. The confusion effect lasts for as long as the creature is in the shadow scream's area of effect and for 1d4 rounds after leaving. Any creature that falls unconscious while under the effects of this confusion effect must succeed at an additional DC 18 Will save or be afflicted by a random insanity&mdash;roll on the insanity table on page 250 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide to determine which. A sacristan's shadow scream lasts for 3 rounds and remains centered on the kyton even if it moves. The sacristan can end the shadow scream at will. The scream also ends if the sacristan is killed or is affected by the spell dimensional lock, which prevents this ability's use for as long as the spell in effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.",
