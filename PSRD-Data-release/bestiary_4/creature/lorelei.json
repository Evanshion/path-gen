This effect even influences undead creatures despite their usual immunity to mind-affecting effects.

A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same lorelei's song for 24 hours. A victim under the effects of the murmur moves toward the lorelei using the most direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Affected creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the lorelei simply stands and offers no resistance to its attacks. This effect continues for as long as the lorelei murmurs and for 1 round thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
