This works like the overrun combat maneuver, but the pard must move at least 30 feet and it gains a +4 bonus on the check. If it succeeds, the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage. If it exceeds a creature's CMD by 5 or more, it stuns the creature for 1 round instead of knocking it prone. The target can make an attack of opportunity, but at a -4 penalty. If the target forgoes an attack of opportunity provoked by this maneuver, it can try to avoid the pard by attempting a DC 19 Reflex save; if successful, it takes only half damage. The pard can only deal phasing attack damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature. When using this ability, the pard can move through up to 5 feet of any solid object, barrier, or difficult terrain as if it were a normal open square. The pard cannot end its movement inside a creature or solid barrier. This ability counts as trample for the purposes of effects that enhance or protect against trample. The save DC is Dexterity-based.",
