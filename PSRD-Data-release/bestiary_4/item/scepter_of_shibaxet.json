The scepter functions as a rod of enemy detection  that can be used any number of times per day. If Pazuzu presents the scepter as a standard action, all creatures within 30 feet who view it become panicked for 1d6 rounds unless they succeed at a DC 23 Will save (this is a mind-affecting fear effect). Once per day, Pazuzu can use the Scepter of Shibaxet  as a rod of cancellation  (this does not deplete or harm the scepter). As a standard action, he can call the scepter to his hand from any distance, even across planar boundaries. As an immediate action, Pazuzu can transform the scepter into a +5 anarchic keen unholy longsword  or return it to its normal shape. None of its other powers can be used in sword form.",
