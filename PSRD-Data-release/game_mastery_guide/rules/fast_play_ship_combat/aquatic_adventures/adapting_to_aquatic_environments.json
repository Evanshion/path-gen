For extended aquatic adventures or for particularly deep explorations, PCs will doubtless need to use magic to continue their adventures. <i>Water breathing</i> is of obvious use, while <i>endure elements</i> can help with temperature. Pressure damage can be avoided entirely with effects such as <i>freedom of movement</i>. Polymorph spells are perhaps the most useful in water, though, if the form assumed is aquatic in nature.</p>",
