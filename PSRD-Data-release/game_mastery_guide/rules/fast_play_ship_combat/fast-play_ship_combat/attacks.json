    "body": "<p id=\"attacks\">Crewmembers in excess of the ship's minimum crew requirement can be allocated to man siege engines. Siege engines attack on the captain's initiative count.</p><p>A ship can also attempt to ram a target if it has its minimum crew. To ram a target, the ship must move at least 30 feet and end with its bow in a square adjacent to the target. The ship's captain then makes a Profession (sailor) check&mdash;if this check equals or exceeds the target's AC, the ship hits its target, inflicting damage as indicated on the ship statistics table to the target, as well as minimum damage to the ramming ship. A ship outfitted with an actual ram siege engine inflicts an additional 3d6 points of damage to the target (the ramming vessel suffers no additional damage).</p>",
