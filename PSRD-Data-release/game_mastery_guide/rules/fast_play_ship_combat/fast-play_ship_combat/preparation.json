    "body": "<p id=\"preparation\">Decide what type of ships are involved in the combat (see Table 7&ndash;49: Ship Statistics). Use a large, blank battle mat to represent the waters on which the battle occurs. A single square corresponds to 30 feet of distance. Represent each ship by placing markers that take up the appropriate number of squares (miniature toy ships make great markers and should be available at most hobby stores). </p>",
