Infestations can only be cured through specific means; no matter how many saving throws are made, the infestation continues to afflict the target. While a <i>remove disease</i> spell (or similar effect) instantly halts an infestation, immunity to disease offers no protection, as the infestation itself is caused by parasites.</td></tr></table>",
