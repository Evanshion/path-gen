Strength and Dexterity don't change as a result of light gravity, but what you can do with such scores does change. These advantages apply to travelers from other planes as well as natives.

This sort of environment can be very disorienting to the newcomer, but it is common on &ldquo;weightless&rdquo; planes.</p><p>Characters on a plane with subjective directional gravity can move normally along a solid surface by imagining &ldquo;down&rdquo; near their feet. If suspended in midair, a character &ldquo;flies&rdquo; by merely choosing a &ldquo;down&rdquo; direction and &ldquo;falling&rdquo; that way. Under such a procedure, an individual &ldquo;falls&rdquo; 150 feet in the first round and 300 feet in each succeeding round. Movement is straight-line only. In order to stop, one has to slow one's movement by changing the designated &ldquo;down&rdquo; direction (again, moving 150 feet in the new direction in the first round and 300 feet per round thereafter).</p><p>It takes a DC 16 Wisdom check to set a new direction of gravity as a free action; this check can be made once per round. Any character who fails this Wisdom check in successive rounds receives a +6 bonus on subsequent checks until he or she succeeds.</p>",
