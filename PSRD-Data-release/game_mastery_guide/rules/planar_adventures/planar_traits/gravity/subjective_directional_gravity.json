    "body": "<p id=\"subjective-directional-gravity\">The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on the Material Plane, but each individual chooses the direction of gravity's pull. Such a plane has no gravity for unattended objects and nonsentient creatures. This sort of environment can be very disorienting to the newcomer, but it is common on &ldquo;weightless&rdquo; planes.</p><p>Characters on a plane with subjective directional gravity can move normally along a solid surface by imagining &ldquo;down&rdquo; near their feet. If suspended in midair, a character &ldquo;flies&rdquo; by merely choosing a &ldquo;down&rdquo; direction and &ldquo;falling&rdquo; that way. Under such a procedure, an individual &ldquo;falls&rdquo; 150 feet in the first round and 300 feet in each succeeding round. Movement is straight-line only. In order to stop, one has to slow one's movement by changing the designated &ldquo;down&rdquo; direction (again, moving 150 feet in the new direction in the first round and 300 feet per round thereafter).</p><p>It takes a DC 16 Wisdom check to set a new direction of gravity as a free action; this check can be made once per round. Any character who fails this Wisdom check in successive rounds receives a +6 bonus on subsequent checks until he or she succeeds.</p>",
