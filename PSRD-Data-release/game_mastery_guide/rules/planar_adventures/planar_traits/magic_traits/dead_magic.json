    "body": "<p id=\"dead-magic\">These planes have no magic at all. A plane with the dead magic trait functions in all respects like an <i>antimagic field</i> spell. Divination spells cannot detect subjects within a dead magic plane, nor can a spellcaster use <i>teleport</i> or another spell to move in or out. The only exception to the &ldquo;no magic&rdquo; rule is permanent planar portals, which still function normally.</p>",
