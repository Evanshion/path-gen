    "body": "<p>A realm of vast wastelands under a rotten sky, Abaddon is perpetually cloaked in a cloying black mist and the oppressive twilight of an endless solar eclipse. The poisoned River Styx has its source in Abaddon, before it meanders like a twisted serpent onto other planes. Abaddon may be the most hostile of the Outer Planes; it is the home of the daemons, fiends of pure evil untouched by the struggle between law and chaos, who personify oblivion and destruction. Daemons, which are ruled by four godlike archdaemons, are feared throughout the Great Beyond as devourers of souls.</p><p>Abaddon has the following traits:</p><ul><li> <b>Divinely Morphic</b>Deities with domains in Abaddon can alter the plane at will. </li><li> <b>Strongly Evil-Aligned</b></li><li> <b>Enhanced Magic</b>: Spells and spell-like abilities with the evil descriptor are enhanced.</li><li> <b>Impeded Magic</b>: Spells and spell-like abilities with the good descriptor are impeded.</li></ul>",
