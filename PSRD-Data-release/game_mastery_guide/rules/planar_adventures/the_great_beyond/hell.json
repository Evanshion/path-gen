    "body": "<p>The nine layers of Hell form a structured labyrinth of calculated evil where torment goes hand in hand with purification. A plane of iron cities, burning wastelands, frozen glaciers, and endless volcanic peaks, Hell is divided into nine nesting layers, each under the malevolent rule of an archdevil. Torture, anguish, and agony are inevitable in Hell, but they are methodical, not spiteful or capricious, and serve a deliberate master plan under the watchful eyes of the disciplined ranks of Hells' lesser devils. The nine layers of Hell, from first to last, are Avernus, Dis, Erebus, Phlegethon, Stygia, Malebolge, Cocytus, Caina, and Nessus.</p><p>Hell has the following traits:</p><ul><li> <b>Divinely Morphic</b>Deities with domains in Hell can alter the plane at will.</li><li> <b>Strongly Law-Aligned and Strongly Evil-Aligned</b></li><li> <b>Enhanced Magic</b>: Spells and spell-like abilities with the lawful or evil descriptor are enhanced. </li><li> <b>Impeded Magic</b>: Spells and spell-like abilities with the chaotic or good descriptor are impeded.</li></ul>",
