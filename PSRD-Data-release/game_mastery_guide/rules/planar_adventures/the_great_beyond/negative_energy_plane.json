    "body": "<p>To an observer, there's little to see on the Negative Energy Plane. It is a dark, empty place, an eternal pit where a traveler can fall until the plane itself steals away all light and life. The Negative Energy Plane is the most hostile of the Inner Planes, the most uncaring and intolerant of life. Only creatures immune to its life-draining energies can survive there.</p><p>The Negative Energy Plane has the following traits:</p><ul><li> <b>Subjective Directional Gravity</b></li><li> <b>Major Negative-Dominant</b>Some areas within the plane have only the minor negative-dominant trait, and these islands tend to be inhabited.</li><li> <b>Enhanced Magic</b>: Spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy are enhanced. Class abilities that use negative energy, such as channel negative energy, gain a +4 bonus to the save DC to resist the ability.</li><li> <b>Impeded Magic</b>: Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy (including cure spells) are impeded. Characters on this plane take a &ndash;10 penalty on saving throws made to remove negative levels bestowed by an energy drain attack.</li></ul>",
