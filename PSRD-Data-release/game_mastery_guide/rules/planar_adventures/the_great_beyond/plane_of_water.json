It is one of the more hospitable of the Inner Planes once a traveler gets past the problem of breathing the local medium.</p><p>The eternal oceans of this plane vary between ice cold and boiling hot, and between saline and fresh. They are perpetually in motion, wracked by currents and tides. The plane's permanent settlements form around bits of flotsam suspended within this endless liquid, drifting on the tides.</p><p>The Plane of Water has the following traits:</p><ul><li> <b>Subjective Directional Gravity</b>The gravity here works similarly to that of the Plane of Air, but sinking or rising on the Plane of Water is slower (and less dangerous) than on the Plane of Air.</li><li> <b>Water-Dominant</b></li><li> <b>Enhanced Magic</b>: Spells and spell-like abilities with the water descriptor or that use or create water (including those of the Water domain or the elemental [water] bloodline) are enhanced.</li><li> <b>Impeded Magic</b>: Spells and spell-like abilities with the fire descriptor or that use or create fire (including spells of the Fire domain, spell-like abilities of the elemental [fire] bloodline, and spells that summon fire elementals or outsiders with the fire subtype) are impeded.</li></ul>",
