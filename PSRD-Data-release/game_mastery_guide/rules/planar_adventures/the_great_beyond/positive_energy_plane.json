    "body": "<p>The Positive Energy Plane has no surface and is akin to the Plane of Air with its wide-open nature. However, every bit of this plane glows brightly with innate power. This power is dangerous to mortal forms, which are not made to handle it. Despite the beneficial effects of the plane, it is one of the most hostile of the Inner Planes. An unprotected character on this plane swells with power as positive energy is forced upon her. Then, because her mortal frame is unable to contain that power, she is immolated, like a mote of dust caught at the edge of a supernova. Visits to the Positive Energy Plane are brief, and even then travelers must be heavily protected.</p><p>The Positive Energy Plane has the following traits:</p><ul><li> <b>Subjective Directional Gravity</b></li><li> <b>Major Positive-Dominant</b>Some regions of the plane have the minor positive-dominant trait instead, and those islands tend to be inhabited.</li><li> <b>Enhanced Magic</b>: Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy are enhanced. Class abilities that use positive energy, such as channel positive energy, gain a +4 bonus to the save DC to resist the ability.</li><li> <b>Impeded Magic</b>: Spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy (including inflict spells) are impeded.</li></ul>",
