    "body": "<p id=\"alignment-and-type\">A settlement's alignment is the general alignment of its citizens and government&mdash;individuals who dwell therein can still be of any alignment, but the majority of its citizens should be within one step of the settlement's overall alignment. Alignment influences a city's modifiers. The type is the size category the settlement falls into, be it thorp, hamlet, village, town (small or large), city (small or large), or metropolis. In most cases, rules play off of a settlement's type rather than its exact population total. A settlement's type determines many of its statistics (see Table 7&ndash;36: Settlement Statistics).</p>",
