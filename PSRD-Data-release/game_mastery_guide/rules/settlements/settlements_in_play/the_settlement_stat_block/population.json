Note that the exact number is flexible; a settlement's actual population can swell on market days or dwindle during winter&mdash;this number lists the average population of the settlement. Note that this number is generally used for little more than flavor&mdash;since actual population totals fluctuate, it's pointless to tether rules to this number. After the settlement's total population, a breakdown of its racial mix is listed in parentheses.</p>",
