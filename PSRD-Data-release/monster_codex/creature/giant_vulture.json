Enemies find goblin vulture pilots tough to pin down as they lob explosive bombs from the air. Vulture pilots are braver, more disciplined, and more patient than most goblins, as they have to sneak into giant vulture nests to steal eggs, resist the temptation to eat those eggs, and raise the hatchlings to be loyal mounts. Many pilots die in flying accidents; the lucky ones often discover how to craft extracts of <i>bouncy body</i>, <i>levitate</i>, or similar effects to help them survive the inevitable crashes.</p>",
