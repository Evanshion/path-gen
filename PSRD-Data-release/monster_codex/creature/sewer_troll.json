They rarely leave the sewers because of their light blindness, but they have been known to hide just below sewer grates and snatch children who walk too close. In times of desperate hunger, sewer trolls may leave the sewers, invariably at night. They stick to the shadows and ambush lone walkers, or sneak through windows to snatch babies from their cribs. Sewer trolls outside of their native environment are easily scared, but woe to the unprepared foe who follows them back into the sewers.</p>",
