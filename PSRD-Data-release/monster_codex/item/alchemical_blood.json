    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This flask of red liquid is enough to for 1 day stave off a vampire's hunger for blood. Few vampires enjoy it; most describe it as tasting stale and artificial. Some, particularly weaker or newer ones, feel that it interferes with the unholy magic keeping their bodies animated. However, it's an option utilized by vampires that are running for their unlives and attempting to stay hidden from vampire hunters. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 40 Craft (alchemy) check.</p>",
