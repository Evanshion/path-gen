    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">These metal sheaths slide onto the claws of a troll. When a troll hits with a claw attack while wearing the sheaths, it can either keep the sheaths on its hand (in which case the claw attack deals 1 extra point of damage) or allow the four sheaths on that hand to slide off and become embedded in the wound (in which case the claw attack deals 1 point of bleed damage). The listed price is for a set of 8 sheaths (one for each claw on both of a troll's four-fingered hands).</p>",
