    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A <i>burning</i> weapon causes an unattended flammable object to ignite when struck (Fortitude DC 13 negates for magic items), dealing 1d6+1 points of fire damage to the object each round after it's ignited. An item made mostly or entirely out of wood is even more susceptible to this effect, taking 2d6+2 points of fire damage. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds. A creature that ends its turn in the same space as a burning object takes 1d6+1 points of fire damage.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Up to three times per day, the bearer of a <i>burning </i> weapon can, on command, cause a single object that has been ignited by the weapon to burn even brighter, increasing the duration of its burning effect by 1d4+1 rounds and causing the fire to expand in a burst that extends 5 feet from the object. This burst of fire deals 1d6+1 points of fire damage to each creature in that area, and it can ignite unattended flammable objects within that area as if they had been hit with the weapon.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Fire giants often make use of <i>burning</i> weapons in their fervid crusades against other races. </p>",
