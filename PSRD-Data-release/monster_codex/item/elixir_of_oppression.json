It allows creatures with the scent ability to smell fear, and instills a bloodlust in the imbiber when it's facing a fearful creature. The imbiber gains a +4 competence bonus on Perception checks made with the scent ability, and a successful DC 15 Perception check allows the imbiber to determine by scent whether a creature is shaken, frightened, or panicked. Once a creature's condition has been identified, the imbiber gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and opposed skill checks against that opponent.These effects last for 1d4+1 hours. If a creature drinks a second elixir of oppression within 24 hours of the first, it is sickened for 24 hours and does not gain the benefits of the second dose.",
