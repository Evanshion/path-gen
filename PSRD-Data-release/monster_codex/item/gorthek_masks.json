    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This set consists of two masks of hammered iron, one sized for a gorthek's face and the other sized for the face of its orc handler. To bond a gorthek with its handler, orcs permanently nail the <i>gorthek masks</i> to the respective wearers' faces. The magic functions only when the <i>gorthek masks</i> are affixed to one orc and one gorthek. It doesn't work with animals other than gortheks. There's only a 60% chance an orc's mask will function when affixed to a non-orc humanoid&mdash;and it's impossible to tell whether a mask will work until after it has been permanently attached.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The orc's mask is fashioned with horns on the side, resembling those of a gorthek. With its bonded gorthek, the wearer gains the benefits of <i>speak with animals</i> and a +10 competence bonus on Handle Animal checks.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The gorthek's mask depicts fearsome tusks, scales, or other features meant to make the creature look more terrifying. A gorthek wearing its mask ignores the first 5 points of hardness of any object it hits with a gore attack when performing a sunder combat maneuver or when smashing an object. Any creature other than its handler takes a &ndash;10 penalty on Handle Animal checks against a bonded gorthek.</p>",
