    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">These black leather fingerless gloves are shot through with strands of giant spider webbing. They allow their wearer to steal the special abilities of an opponent's weapon and augment the wearer's unarmed strikes with the abilities instead.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Once per day, the wearer can activate the gloves by succeeding at an unarmed disarm combat maneuver against an opponent's magic weapon. Instead of disarming the weapon, the wearer can negate the weapon's special abilities (<i>bane</i>, <i>flaming</i>, and so on) for 1d4 rounds and apply these abilities to her own unarmed strikes (the weapon's enhancement bonus is unaffected). Any weapon special abilities that couldn't be applied to unarmed strikes (such as <i>returning</i> or <i>vorpal</i> ) are still suspended on the weapon but are not applied to the wearer's unarmed attacks.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If the wearer's unarmed strikes already have magical weapon special abilities (such as from an <i>amulet of mighty fists</i> ), the enhancement bonus and special ability bonus equivalents on the wearer's unarmed strikes can't total more than +10; stolen special abilities are discarded at random until the total is +10 or less (discarded abilities are still suspended in the opponent's weapon for the normal duration).</p>",
