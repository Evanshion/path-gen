    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This animated wood and metal snake squirms and hisses when handled, attempting to bite its holder just as a real snake might. To use the <i>snakebiter arrow</i> as a projectile, the bearer must first succeed at a DC 10 Handle Animal or wild empathy check to get the snake to shape itself into a <i>+1 seeking arrow</i> or a <i>+1 seeking bolt</i> (this is considered a trick known by the snake) for 1 minute. Failure means the snake attacks the bearer for 1 round, using the statistics of a Tiny viper familiar. A target struck by the projectile must succeed at a saving throw or be affected by a powerful variant black adder venom (Fortitude DC 20). Normally, these items are carried in a pouch rather than a quiver to prevent them from getting loose.</p>",
