    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This alchemical fluid is viscous and clear, and it emits a strong chemical smell when exposed to air. Vermin are attracted to it and perceive anything marked with it as prey. Spiders, insects, and similar vermin gain a +5 bonus on Perception checks and attack rolls against a creature marked with spiderdraw; if these creatures have the scent ability, they can detect a marked creature at five times the normal range, note its direction as a free action, and pinpoint it when it is within 25 feet.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Drow sometimes use spiderdraw as a contact poison or splash weapon against opponents, allowing vermin to focus on the marked targets while the drow retreat, regroup, or move to a more advantageous position. Washing off the spiderdraw is a full-round action requiring at least a gallon of water or other suitable washing liquid; otherwise, the effects last for 1 hour.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Crafting <i>spiderdraw</i> requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.</p>",
