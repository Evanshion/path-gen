Three times per day, the <i>spikebones</i> can be cast upon the ground as a standard action to create an area of dangerous spikes. Bony in color and shape, these sharp protrusions function like a <i>spike growth</i> spell. The spikes fill four contiguous 10-foot-square areas, shaped by the user at the time of deployment. The spikes remain effective for up to 3 hours, after which they vanish and the <i>spikebones</i> magically reappearing in their pouch.</p>",
