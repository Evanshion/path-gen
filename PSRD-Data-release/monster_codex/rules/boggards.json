            "body": "<p>Living in soggy, disease-ridden marshes, boggards are often isolated from other humanoids&mdash;a condition that breeds suspicion of foreign visitors, ideas, and technology. This marginalization has distilled their brutality to the point where the strongest members subjugate and often consume their weaker kin. At the top of the food chain stand the boggards' priest-kings (a term that applies to both male and female rulers)&mdash;tyrannical prophets who rule over their uneducated subjects.</p><p>A boggard's life begins in a spawning pool as one of roughly a dozen gelatinous eggs laid in a frothy clutch. After a month-long gestation, the tadpoles gnaw their way out of their eggs and spend the following 9 months feeding on anything they can find&mdash;including weak and unlucky siblings. During this time, the tadpoles grow stubby arms and legs that quickly elongate and strengthen enough for them to crawl out of the pools. This feat isn't enough to secure them a place in boggard society, since caretakers cull the weakest and any showing signs of deformities.</p><p>The exceptions to this rule are the priest-king's offspring, who are fed meals of poisonous dragonflies. This diet kills most, and those few who survive develop differently from other boggards. Some have greater mental capacity and spell-like abilities, marking them as potential future priest-kings. But many survivors mature into the stunted, barely intelligent horrors known as bogwiggles.</p><p>Young boggards live in cadres that comprise a dozen or more adolescents led by a handful of more experienced warriors. The youths receive a modicum of care and protection during the first year out of water, during which they learn the practical skills necessary for life and service to their ruler. Virtually all boggards receive the same type of training, which emphasizes athletic prowess, hunting skills, and a broad set of rudimentary crafts.</p><p>When boggards reach roughly 3 years of age, they are considered adults and are sent away from the community for a month-long ritual hunt. Those who return with the corpse of a sapient humanoid earn approval, a place in the society, and a grand celebratory meal. Those who fail are exiled or consumed.</p><p>Priest-kings are typically larger than their kin, sometimes growing so bloated and ponderous he seems to belong to a different species entirely. Their effective monopoly on divine magic further reinforces the gap between rulers and their subjects. When the reigning priest-king dies (often from violence), the heirs compete to claim the throne. The victor almost always kills off her siblings to reinforce her claim.</p><p>Boggards are extremely fertile, and their culture encourages them to reproduce as often as resources permit. Despite the large number of young, systemic cannibalism keeps the boggard population in check. Boggards embrace this practice as a way of weeding out the weak and empowering the strong, though the fact that even the youngest offspring engage in it suggests cannibalism is instinctive&mdash;an expression of the species' ravenous appetite.</p><p>Nonetheless, as survivors of numerous broods born in competitive environments, boggards are highly adaptive, capable of weathering ecological disasters and evolving to exploit new environments&mdash;much to the frustration of other intelligent creatures that compete with them. What many think of as the \"typical\" boggard is well adapted to life in marshes, yet boggards also thrive in rainforests, where they often develop more colorful skin patterns. Like the amphibians they resemble, some boggards have developed the ability to estivate, allowing them to survive extended droughts and food shortages. As a result, it's rare but not impossible to find boggards exploiting periods of rain in deserts, during which time they are especially aggressive.</p><p>Boggard settlements are usually arranged in a manner that reinforces the hierarchy. The priest-king's dwelling stands near the center on a low, ziggurat-like mound of compacted mud, and those mounds claimed by direct subordinates radiate outward. The higher the mound and the closer it is to the monarch's home, the greater the resident boggard's status. The creatures further display their importance by studding their homes with bones, shells, reeds, and various exotic materials. Stealing a neighbor's ornaments often leads to violence&mdash;but if the thief is victorious, then clearly she was right to take what she wanted.</p><p>Hunting and gathering make up the bulk of the boggards' way of life, and their crafts are typically limited to simple constructions of stone and organic matter. Some priest-kings intentionally rotate who is working on a project to keep any one boggard from becoming exceptional. What boggards can't make or gather, they steal from other humanoids. Metal items are rare in boggard society&mdash;most metals simply can't withstand long-term exposure to a damp environment. Magic weapons and armor are therefore prized for their resistance to corrosion.</p><p>Two beliefs are central to boggards' religious and spiritual experience. First, the weak should be recycled to empower the strong, from cannibalizing the infirm to claiming the weapons of a fallen comrade to stealing a neighbor's home. Second, might makes right, especially for the priest-king, whose divine power is typically bestowed by an evil god or demon lord. Common boggards' reliance on their leader for spiritual guidance breeds a debilitating superstition in many. Those who can't abide by the beliefs of boggard society are cast out, and boggards who hear tales of these hermits respond with a mix of disdain and uneasiness.</p><p>Metamorphosis fascinates boggards, from the development of their young to the transformation of priest-kings. Those who parley with boggards can sometimes awe the creatures with transformative magic.</p><p>Full statistics for boggards can be found in their &lt;i&gt;Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; entry.</p>",
