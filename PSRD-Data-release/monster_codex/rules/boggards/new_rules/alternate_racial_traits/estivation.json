    "body": "<p>Not all marshes are wet year-round, and some boggards have adapted to life in seasonal swamps where hot, arid conditions are common. A boggard with this racial trait can spend 1 hour burying herself in wet or soft earth and entering a state of suspended animation for an indefinite amount of time. While estivating, a boggard doesn't need to drink or eat, but takes a penalty on Perception checks as if sleeping. Ending this dormant state is a full-round action. This racial trait replaces a boggard's racial bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump.</p>",
