    "body": "<p>Boggards raised on a diet of blue dragonfly pulp sometimes develop into priest-kings. These boggards have only a +2 natural armor bonus but don't take the common boggard's &ndash;2 racial penalty to Dexterity and Intelligence. In addition, priest-kings receive a +4 racial bonus to Wisdom and gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day&mdash;<i>fog cloud</i>, <i>jump</i>, <i>summon swarm</i> . The caster level for these effects is equal to the boggard's Hit Dice. This racial trait doesn't replace any of a boggard's other features, but it's extremely rare and available only at the GM's discretion.</p>",
