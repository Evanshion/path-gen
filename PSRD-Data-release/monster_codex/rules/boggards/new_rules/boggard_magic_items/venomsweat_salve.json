During this time, a creature that strikes the user with a natural weapon attack or unarmed strike is exposed to the poison. As a swift action, the user can apply the poison to a weapon. As a standard action, the user can deliver the poison as a touch attack. The salve creates a total of 3 doses of venomsweat poison, and any unused doses of poison harmlessly evaporate after 1 hour.</p>",
