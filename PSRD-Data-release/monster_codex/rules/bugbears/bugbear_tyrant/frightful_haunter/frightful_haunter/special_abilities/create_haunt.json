    "body": "A frightful haunter has so much rage and desire to create fear that it can actually create a haunt once per hour. Each haunt has a CR no greater than the frightful haunter's CR &ndash; 2, and often takes a form either tied to the location the frightful haunter selects for it or inspired by the victims the frightful haunter hopes to frighten.<p class=\"stat-block-2\">Unlike a typical haunt, those created by a frightful haunter are destroyed when neutralized, and fade away after a number of days equal to the creator's Hit Dice. A frightful haunter cannot have more than 1 haunt active per HD; if any haunt is created that exceeds that limit, the oldest active haunt is neutralized.</p>",
