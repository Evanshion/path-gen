    "body": "A creature struck by a frightful haunter's touch attack takes 3d8 points of damage and must succeed at a DC 17 Will saving throw or be shaken for 1 minute. A creature that succeeds at the save can't be made shaken by the terrifying touch for 24 hours, but can still take damage from it. Successfully using terrifying touch multiple times extends only the duration of its effect; it does not create a stronger fear condition. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The DC is Charisma-based.",
