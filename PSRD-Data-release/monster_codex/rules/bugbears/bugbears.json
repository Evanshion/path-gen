    "body": "<p>Bugbears are the terrors that make other humanoids fear the night. They are cruel killers driven as strongly by a need to cause fear, pain, and misery as they are driven to seek food and shelter. A bugbear cares nothing about other creatures, even members of its own family, and has no motivations beyond finding the best way to feed its dark passions.</p><p>Bugbears and their albino snow-stalking cousins, wikkawaks, are the largest of goblinoids, standing nearly 7 feet tall&mdash;or they would if they were to stand up straight, but most bugbears prefer a hunched posture. These hulking creatures weigh up to 400 pounds (or 450 pounds for wikkawaks). They have facial features similar to those of goblins and hobgoblins, but on squatter, broader faces. Their faces are bare, but the rest of their bodies are covered in rough, shaggy hair that is often matted or sticking out at odd angles. Despite their bulging muscles and prodigious mass, bugbears move with startling grace and stealth. Simply watching a bugbear stalk its prey, its bulky, top-heavy form gliding silently though spaces that seem too small for it to pass through, is enough to unnerve observers.</p><p>Bugbears are more likely than other goblinoids to live solitary lives. Their dislike of being dragged down by the weaknesses and needs of others makes them inherently distrusting of even their own clans and immediate families. This is especially true for wikkawaks, who band together temporarily only to raid villages or to mate. Both types of goblinoids are well suited to solo survival&mdash;their excellent senses allow them to identify threats while still far enough away to avoid those too great to overcome, and their natural stealth helps them journey undetected to hidden places in which to sleep or store a cache of supplies. Of course, lone bugbears are more vulnerable to being hunted down when sick or injured, and knowledge of this weakness keeps them cautious. An injured bugbear on its own seeks prey weak enough to pose little risk, even as it hopes the prey will be strong enough to be tormented for weeks or months.</p><p>Once a lone bugbear begins to grow infirm from age, it must either convince a group to take it in, or skulk in the shadows, avoiding all risks and pining after past glories. While bugbears are not generous creatures, a fair-sized bugbear clan is often willing to take in an elder for two reasons. First, the newcomer's infirmity makes it less of a threat to existing leaders of the clan. Second, an old bugbear is considered a wily bugbear, likely to know the secrets of silently stalking and killing. While bugbears have little use for most other forms of knowledge, reliable lessons and anecdotes on these subjects are valued as both wisdom and entertainment.</p><p>The typical bugbear clan is little more than a family with a history of not betraying each other overly much, and is thus extremely fragile. A bugbear may decide it would rather prey on members of its clan than on more distant victims, scarcity often forces bugbear families to fight among themselves for food and shelter, and one bugbear might simply attack another for no reason at all. No laws or stabilizing traditions prevent a single incident from becoming an all-out conflict. Conflicts often tear the fragile clan apart unless a new leader rises from the carnage and enforces a semblance of order.</p><p>The few stable bugbear societies tend to fall into two broad categories: bugbear ghettos and cabals. In bugbear ghettos, a number of the creatures live under the rules (and watchful eyes) of a more stable governance. In some cases, this is a single powerful ruler such as a giant or dragon. That ruler must be powerful or crafty enough to instill sufficient fear into the bugbears to prevent them from starting trouble within its holdings, which is seldom easy. Such rulers employ bugbears as spies, torturers, and secret police, taking advantage of their natural cruelty, alertness, and surreptitiousness to keep other factions in line.</p><p>Bugbear ghettos also occasionally form in more organized societies, especially among hobgoblins. In these cases, the bugbears are treated as second-class citizens and forced to serve as scouts and mercenary troops. While each bugbear may be able to kill any given hobgoblin, organized hobgoblins militias can often keep the fragmented and selfish bugbears in line and crush any rebellions against hobgoblin rule.</p><p>Bugbears in such ordered societies are often more savage and angry than their freer kin, raging against the limitations that prevent them from creating panic and mayhem however they desire. While some may flee to attempt solo lives, a well-organized military or tyranny can impress upon small groups of bugbears that it is better to serve and live than to rebel and die.</p><p>The second form of bugbear society is the even rarer cabal, where a small group of bugbears rules over a larger population of other humanoids&mdash;often goblins, orcs, or kobolds. A bugbear cabal can't be considered a government or even a clan in the true senses of those words. It is instead a gang of thugs who have successfully taken control of some other group through pure bullying and extortion. While the cabal has the final say in the community, it leaves the details of governance to functionaries from the subject group.</p><p>While it might seem that being an agent of the cabal is the best position within such a settlement, bugbears enjoy terrorizing their most important agents as much as they love creating fear and misery among their lower-ranked subjects. A bugbear cabal rules through fear and random displays of force, and its subjects quickly learn that the best way to survive is to draw no attention at all. However, since someone must see to the needs of the government, the bugbears force senior members of the populace to do that work, and torture them if they fail in their duties.</p><p>Full statistics for bugbears can be found in their &lt;i&gt;Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; entry.</p>",
