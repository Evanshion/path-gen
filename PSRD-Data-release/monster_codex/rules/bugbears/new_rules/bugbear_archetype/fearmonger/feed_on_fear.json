    "body": "<p id=\"feed-on-fear\">At 2nd level, the first time in a round a creature fails a saving throw against a fear effect created by a fearmonger's spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability (including any ability that causes a creature to be shaken, frightened, or panicked), the fearmonger is healed of 1 point of damage per 2 antipaladin levels. If the fearmonger is at full hit points when this ability is activated, he instead gains an equal number of temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. Temporary hit points gained through multiple successful uses of this ability do not stack; the duration increases instead.</p><p>The antipaladin can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level plus his Charisma bonus. This ability replaces touch of corruption.</p>",
