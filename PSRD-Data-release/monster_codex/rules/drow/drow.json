    "body": "<p>Dark elves number among the cruelest, most sadistic creatures to live above or below the surface of the world. While no intelligent race is uniformly evil or uniformly good, drow society codifies brutality, rewards viciousness, and roots out those who don't conform to the race's elevation of malice and chaos. These dogmas permeate all aspects of drow life&mdash;an existence punctuated by betrayal, assassination, calculated scheming, and baseless acts of destruction. Most cultures holding to such beliefs would quickly be consumed by the chaos they embrace, but dark elves have forged an enduring society in which civility and a caste-based hierarchy balance the ever-present machinations and acts of treachery.</p><p>Dark elves resemble their surface kin in form: lithe and graceful, with angular features and distinctly pointed ears. However, centuries of divergence have made the two races inverted reflections of one another. A dark elf's skin is either a cold blue-black, lusterless like a starless night or with a sheen akin to volcanic glass, or a deep purple, like the diluted violet of a dawn sky. Drow eyes are milky white with no pupils, adapted to an existence with little or no light. A dark elf's hair is typically white and fine.</p><p>Most surface elves think of the drow as a different race&mdash;one that represents all that \"true\" elves shun and have cast away. The hard truth is that the dark elves originated when a corruption transformed surface elves. The drow are proof of the lurking possibility of evil in any creature.</p><p>The true origin of the drow is shrouded in the darkness of the caverns beneath the surface of the world. After a great cataclysm drove the surface elves from their homes, many took shelter in tunnels beneath the earth. Orcs, duergar, and even fouler creatures battled them for survival in this lightless world, and time and again the elves found themselves outmatched by creatures better suited to the environment. Defeat and desperation forced them to flee deeper and deeper.</p><p>Eventually, their flight into the depths of the world brought the elves close to a mysterious source of unbridled chaos and malevolence. This influence warped their bodies and minds, granting them great power at the cost of their morality and souls. Just as they had fled their ancestral lands above, so now had they fled from what made them elves in the first place. Rather than resist this influence, the elves embraced it. The lost tribe became the first of the world's drow.</p><p>In the centuries to follow, the dark elves grew more at home in the dark. They developed supernatural powers, perfected the use of poisons, gained the ability to see in the dark, and became able to resist magical attacks. In time, they embarked upon a campaign to conquer the lands beneath the world, deeming themselves superior to all other forms of mortal life. They sought aid and further power to achieve their aims more quickly. Their priests turned to the Abyss, pledging themselves and their families to numerous demon lords&mdash;and the demons were eager to accept the drow's fealty. Favor with a demon lord became a key element to securing power within drow society.</p><p>In the ensuing millennia, the drow became the undisputed masters of their lightless realm. As they spread, they created vast underground cities ruled by fickle noble houses. Eventually, however, demonic influence and the drow's ingrained cruelty turned their focus and resolve into endless treachery. The Lords of the Abyss delight in the fractious mayhem of their vassals, regardless of whether they are slaughtering other races or each other. While such a society comprising lesser beings might have quickly collapsed, the drow's civilization endured, in part because of mercilessly enforced laws and etiquette that rein in their pitiless aspirations and most audacious betrayals.</p><p>As a result of the Abyssal compact that twisted dark elf society into what it is today, roughly one drow child in 20 is born with magical powers that far exceed those of her peers. These \"noble drow\" usually climb to the highest peaks of dark elf society. For reasons that remain unclear, drow nobles are almost exclusively female. This skewing of power helped shape the strong and brutal matriarchy now ingrained in drow culture.</p><p>The upper echelon of any drow settlement, underground village, or grand metropolis is uniformly female. In larger cities, drow matrons head great houses that serve as both centers for their families and power nexuses. These matrons are often clerics or wizards, as are their cadres of advisors. Regiments of trained drow warriors serve each house and its matron. The drow toiling in the direct shadow of a great house affirm their loyalty by reporting the schemes and ambitions of other servants, in an attempt to curry favor and gain the privilege of serving greater members of the house. Outside the noble houses, drow act as merchants, traders, and information brokers. Life for non-nobles is a delicate balancing act of maintaining lucrative relationships with influential houses while avoiding becoming entangled in others' feuds.</p><p>Slaves constitute the lowest level of drow society. Drow covet these captives of other subterranean races, and collect them as spoils of battle. The drow put slaves to work mining ore, constructing elaborate subterranean structures, and toiling in the great fungus beds that feed the dark elves. Most lead short, terrible lives as the drow work them to death. Slaves with specialized training like spellcasters, linguists, or sages sometimes serve in non-noble drow households, where they perform roles that drow servants fill in the greater houses. While this existence is better than that of menial laborers, the drow's relentless pursuit of social status ensures that any house that uses \"common\" races as servants will one day rid themselves of these markers of lower-class living.</p><p>Full statistics for drow can be found in their &lt;i&gt;Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; entry.</p>",
