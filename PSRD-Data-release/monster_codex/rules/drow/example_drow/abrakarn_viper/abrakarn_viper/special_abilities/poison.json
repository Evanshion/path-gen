    "body": "An abrakarn viper's bite injects poison from a hidden reservoir within its body. The creator must refill this reservoir manually. The reservoir holds enough poison for three successful bite attacks, after which the creature merely deals bite damage. Refilling the reservoir takes 5 rounds and provokes attacks of opportunity. The creator can fill the reservoir with any injury poison (typically drow poison).",
