    "body": "The wearer of an abrakarn viper's diadem can activate this ability as a standard action when within 100 feet of the viper. This ability transfers half the damage that would be dealt to the diadem's wearer to the viper (this ability does not provide the bonuses to AC or on saving throws granted by the spell of the same name). Damage transferred in this way bypasses any defensive abilities the viper possesses (such as immunity or damage reduction).",
