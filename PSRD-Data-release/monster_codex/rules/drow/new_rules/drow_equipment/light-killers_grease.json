    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Keenly aware of their vulnerability to light and to those who wield it as a weapon, the drow have pioneered many ways to defend themselves against light&mdash;magic or otherwise. Light-killer's grease is a pungent, oily alchemical substance harvested from underground fungus and mixed with powdered minerals common in the deep earth.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">When combined correctly, this black, tarry mass absorbs light. It must be applied around a creature's eyes (a full-round action) to function. When worn, it negates the dazzled condition from exposure to bright light and grants a +1 alchemical bonus on saving throws against spells and effects with the light descriptor. The grease is considered an overpowering scent for the purpose of the scent special ability, and a creature with scent can pinpoint the wearer's location at a range of 10 feet instead of 5 feet.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Once applied, the grease remains potent for 1 hour. Removing the grease is a full-round action that requires a gallon of water or another suitable washing liquid; otherwise, the visual marks can be removed, ending the effect, but the smell remains for the full duration.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Crafting <i>light-killer's grease</i> requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check.</p>",
