            "body": "<p>When veterans of campaigns in the deep caverns beneath the world gather, they hiss warnings to those of a mind to brave the world's depths. They speak with horror of the drow and shudder when describing the perversions of the derros, but avoid altogether talk of the gray dwarves and their grim enclaves. It's a difficult subject in the presence of friendly dwarves whose ancestors long ago heard the call of the surface world. The duergar's folly serves as a lesson on the hazards of pride and stubbornness, and lays bare those flaws of the dwarven people.</p><p>Clannish, hateful, and malevolent tyrants and slavers, the gray dwarves refuse to accept the consequences of their own actions and the reality of their chosen fate. Instead, they blame everyone else: the orcs, the drow, and especially their own surface-dwelling cousins. They believe&mdash;with an iron-hard certainty&mdash;that the surface dwarves are the true traitors of their race. But this is all delusion. The duergar are a race enslaved by themselves, the dark powers they called upon for succor, and the lightless labyrinths of their home.</p><p>The gray dwarves believe that other creatures are fit only for service and torment. The reasons for this perceived racial supremacy vary slightly from community to community, but the underlying narratives are the same: the strong nature of the duergar has allowed them to stand on their own in the depths, and this strength has forged them into a superior race.</p><p>The dwarves have always been people of the earth. In the early days of the world, they mined air-filled spaces miles underground, and the light and skies of the surface were unknown to them. But like all great empires, the doom of this one was written in the stars the dwarves had not yet spied.</p><p>The dwarves were lucky, for their gods were good and just, and cared for the welfare of the dwarven people. When the end was nigh, the gods sent warnings and portents, and the mystics and the wise among the race heard the call and warned their kin. But there are always those who doubt. Some cling to the life they know and foolishly think it is their birthright until the end of eternity. Some doubt because it is in their nature, or because they fear others wish to take what is theirs. While great masses of the dwarves headed upward to the new halls on the surface world promised to them, a number stayed behind, proclaiming themselves masters of the ancient dwarven holds.</p><p>Less than a generation after the great retreat, the calamities that were foretold came to pass. The once-grand subterranean holds were ripped apart by earthquakes and scorched by magma flows. Those who remained had to flee deeper into the earth in search of pockets of relative safety and calm, competing with an influx of ancient enemies, displaced predators, and unspeakable evils freed from once-sealed vaults deep under the earth. Within only a few years, most of the dwarves left behind had perished, and the survivors were scattered and utterly desperate. In their hour of need, their calls to the old gods were answered only with silence. Such entreaties were nothing more than screams into the darkness... but sometimes the darkness answers back.</p><p>According to legend, an outcast dwarven god heard the pleas of those left to suffer. A deceiver and a cheat, this god had lost nearly all of his former followers, but offered these forsaken dwarves one chance for survival: if they worshiped and served him, and bound their descendants to the same fate, he would restore them to glory. Given little choice, the desperate dwarves agreed. The outcast god turned the dwarves' skin ashen gray and caused most of the males' hair (except for eyebrows and beards) to fall out as a reminder of the bargain made, so their gray faces&mdash;or <i>duergar</i> in the Dwarven tongue&mdash;would set them apart from those cowards who fled the crucible that forged the true members of the dwarven race.</p><p>Since that cataclysm and the deal they wrought, the duergar have steadily taken back what was once theirs using the tools of their new lord: murder, slavery, toil, and hatred. Believing themselves the true race of dwarves, they have no interest in the land above other than engaging in occasional raids to murder their cousins or to replenish their stock of slaves. They see themselves as the masters of the only land worth having: the mineral-rich true homeland of the dwarven people.</p><p>Duergar believe their society is the ideal state of the dwarves. In many ways, duergar society is like a reflection of dwarven society seen in a distorted mirror. Rivalries are just as fierce, but among the duergar, they can easily end in murder or mutilation. Work is revered, but the duergar's greatest achievements are built on the backs of slaves, many of whom do not survive to see the end results of their toil.</p><p>The entire structure of duergar society is based on the sacrifice they made to their outcast god and the repercussions of that deal. Each is a slave to his master, and must submit to a life of toil in order to repay the debt the duergar owe. Of course, that debt can never be repaid, and no rewards for their labor await duergar in the afterlife. This leads them to create works that lack soul or beauty&mdash;highly utilitarian, but stark, cold, and lifeless.</p><p>Like their hated kin, duergar divide themselves into large kinship clans, forming alliances through marriage. The priesthood stands apart, and arbitrates in legal and familial conflicts. Duergar who enter the clergy are bound to sever their ties with family and clan, but this is rarely the case in practice. Obligations to kin often outweigh priests' sense of duty, resulting in a system of law with very little semblance of justice. Slavish devotion to the faith of their liberator and a strict adherence to the common law are lauded in duergar society, so much so that duergar's word is only rarely broken. In truth, though, a canny gray dwarf uses her words very carefully in order to keep her options flexible. A common duergar expression is \"Dealings done within sight are slaves to law; deeds done in secret are slaves only to purpose.\"</p><p>Full statistics for duergar can be found in their &lt;i&gt;Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; entry.</p>",
