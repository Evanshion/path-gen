            "body": "<p>When orc raiders ransack a sleepy countryside settlement, it's a tragedy; when fire giants do the same, the result is utter devastation. The distinction between an apocalypse and a raid by fire giants is semantics alone, as the conflagrations caused by these terrible warlords can consume villages, strongholds, and entire cities.</p><p>Fire giants simultaneously embody the tempered reserve of finely crafted steel and the fury of wildfires. They are both the most warlike and the most organized of the giant races. They are contemplative, strategic, and violent&mdash;a dangerous combination for those that fall beneath the fierce gaze of fire giant nobility and their bloodthirsty generals. Fire giants' military campaigns are always preceded by careful, lengthy deliberation. Their war rooms and courts churn with activity; indeed, the undercurrent of violence can be felt in every facet of fire giant society.</p><p>Numerous societies mention fire giants in their fables and histories, though never in a flattering light. Always portrayed as ruthless soldiers and cunning warlords, and often placed at the heart of devastating legends and stories of catastrophe, fire giants exemplify the horrors of war. This isn't because they're gifted with supernatural strength or because the boulders they hurl at their enemies smolder with heat and anger&mdash;those traits are accessories at best. The truth is far more dire than can be illustrated in any apocryphal myth or children's story: fire giants are intimately associated with war and destruction in lore and legend simply because they are strong and they despise the weak. Unfortunately for most of the world's other races, fire giants automatically perceive anything smaller than themselves as weak and pathetic.</p><p>Fire giants dwell among craggy mountains and rocky badlands. They make their workshops in the cores of volcanoes, powering their forges with energy tapped from flowing lava and quenching their blazing arms and armor with the blood of their quarry. The smog created by fire giants' immense smelting factories and smithies roils with lightning and thunder during the dry season, and the black soot that hangs over a fire giant settlement might be mistaken by smaller folk for volcano smoke, though few lowland dwellers hold this misconception for long.</p><p>Love is a mostly foreign concept among fire giants. Procreation occurs rarely, and often only as a by-product of other passions&mdash;a fire giant might feel the stir of desire after a glorious battlefield victory or the public decapitation of a reviled enemy, for instance. Conception is celebrated in the clan, but only because the birth of a strong child means another hearty warrior to add to the fire giants' ranks.</p><p>The formative years of a fire giant's life are as marked by war as are the lives of the adults in the tribe. From birth, a youth is outfitted in custom-forged armor that is remolded and replaced as needed to fit the youngster's growing frame. It takes nearly half a century for a fire giant to reach adulthood; this period is a time of endless, brutal, bloody training. Sparring matches and competitions of strength are common measures of young fire giants' skill and promise. Tribal leaders watch such matches carefully, ever on the lookout for prospective future generals. They also identify those who are to be relegated to lesser positions in the tribe, and weaklings destined to be culled from the group. Fire giant society has no room for those who cannot pull their own weight. All young fire giants must demonstrate their worth by surviving for a time in exile outside the tribe's holdings, or die trying.</p><p>Fire giants revel in warfare on any scale. Massacres and genocides entertain these hungry brutes as much as do small-scale skirmishes or one-on-one wrestling bouts. Of course, the battles that result in the most spilled blood are the ones that make it into fire giants' own oral legends. They have virtually no written lore, because they consider transcribing tales of warfare a waste of time&mdash;to fire giants, writing is best used to tally the deaths of their foes, count their mounds of pillaged riches, and catalog the slaves captured from the latest raid. Such bookkeeping is usually the work of enslaved scribes, so that no fire giants need sully their hands with ink or paper.</p><p>Possibly the only factor that has stopped fire giants from spreading to the farthest corners of the globe and dominating entire nations is their fractious nature&mdash;their clans and tribes are constantly at odds with one another. Even in regions where fire giant rule is already practically ensured, rival clans might be unable to secure control if they cannot select a single ruler to unify and guide them. Their quick tempers and great pride makes treaties and alliances rare, and more than once a powerful fire giant kingdom has crumbled beneath the weight of such arrogance.</p><p>Battles between fire giant clans are dramatic spectacles to behold&mdash;gouts of lava burst from the earth as magmablades call upon their fell flame magic, and steam hog-riding cavalry create veritable earthquakes as they charge headlong into the fiery fray. Such skirmishes might take place anywhere&mdash;location makes no difference to feuding fire giants. Woe betide any innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire of these epic clashes; entire settlements have been obliterated in the collateral damage of a fire giant feud.</p><p>Fire giants hold might as the surest way to determine one's right to rule. Rulers who do not impose their strength upon those beneath them are weak and deserve to be deposed, while those who enforce their will by fear and brawn are formidable kings and queens indeed. The monarchic structure of fire giant society ensures that the lowest members of the clan know their place among the forges and the anvils, and it entrenches members of the nobility in the upper echelons of this brutish hierarchy.</p><p>Full statistics for fire giants can be found in their &lt;i&gt;Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; entry.</p>",
