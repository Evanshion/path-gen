    "body": "As a standard action, a steam hog can emit a cloud of steam from its snout in a 10-foot-radius spread. The initial burst of steam deals 2d6 points of fire damage to any creature in the area. The cloud remains for 1d4 rounds once created, acting as a 10-foot-radius obscuring mist . Any creature that begins its turn in the area of the steam must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. A steam hog can use its steam cloud only once every 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
