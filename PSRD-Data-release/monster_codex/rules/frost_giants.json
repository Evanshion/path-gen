            "body": "<p>Natives of snow-capped peaks and primordial lands of unending winter, frost giants consider themselves the rightful inheritors of the world's cold places. They raid, conquer, and take slaves with wanton brutality. Lesser races who shiver and hide from the chilling winds exist only to serve them&mdash;as labor, as sport, and sometimes as meat.</p><p>Frost giants are among the larger giants, with males standing 15 feet tall and weighing roughly 2,800 pounds, and females being only slightly smaller. Most frost giants have pale blue skin the color of glacial ice, though shades can vary from deep blue to the white of fresh snow. Their hair grows in pale shades of blue, white, or dirty yellow; it is typically worn long and tied in braids, including beards. A frost giant's eyes typically match its hair, though with much more vivid colors. Frost giants' glacial coloration helps them camouflage themselves in the frigid lands they call home, and they often raid during ice storms to further capitalize on this fact.</p><p>Frost giants bear nearly the same proportions as humans, if more muscle-bound and broad-shouldered on average. Like other humanoids, they are warm-blooded, but their bodies have adapted to emit only infinitesimal amounts of heat via their skin and breath, and their blood cannot freeze, rendering them impervious to even the most frigid cold. However, their blood boils easily, and they become uncomfortably hot in more moderate climes.</p><p>A creature as massive as a frost giant requires a great deal of food to keep going, which the giants supply mostly by hunting and raiding. Caribou, elk, and other megafauna of the frozen reaches make up the bulk of their diet. The skins and hides of these creatures are put to use as clothing, bedding, and tents. Frost giants see no reason to engage in agriculture, mining, or raising livestock, given that their immense strength makes it far easier to raid for what they need. Most goods among the giants are stolen or created by enslaved members of smaller races. Cheese and butter are particularly prized.</p><p>About half of all frost giant tribes are seminomadic, migrating between campsites and temporary settlements whenever the local supply of game or plunder begins to run out. The other half take up permanent residence in captured castles or in fortresses carved from stone or ice. The giants' refusal to practice agriculture, however, means that those who settle in one place require relatively large subject populations to raid from, and may even rely on subordinate frost giant tribes that range farther afield and supply them with tribute.</p><p>Frost giants' love of raiding is legendary, and rightly feared among mountain towns the world over. They have so perfected the art of raiding that they leave enough residents of a town alive that the town can be rebuilt, allowing them to sack it again later once it's amassed enough loot to be worthwhile. In general, frost giants enjoy combat for its own sake, and prefer a quick plundering to holding territory. They particularly enjoy the thrill of fighting smaller humanoids, as it allows them to sate their bloodlust in relative safety.</p><p>Because they value strength over all, frost giants are sometimes brought under the command of yet greater evils. In these cases, they are usually glorified mercenaries, who cooperate as long as they're kept supplied with food, weapons, and riches, be it by pay or by pillage. Yet non-giant individuals capable of cowing a tribe are rare&mdash;even white dragons can end up as thralls of powerful frost giant tribes.</p><p>The ruler of a frost giant tribe typically assumes the title of jarl. This title is never claimed by means of democracy or heredity, but rather belongs to any with the strength to take it via personal challenge. When two jarls meet, one or the other must cede her title and become a mere \"chieftain\" or \"warlord,\" an issue usually decided by swift and brutal combat. In this way, a strong jarl can command many subordinate tribes, though these arrangements inevitably prove to be temporary, for frost giants rankle at servitude. Most chieftains are continually second-guessing the jarl's leadership and looking for opportunities to break away or take power for themselves.</p><p>As frost giants prefer the glory of combat over the tedium of work, they keep slaves (called thralls) to assist with tasks like preparing food or tanning hides. The giants make poor masters, often killing these thralls through exhaustion or petty cruelty. The giants are also not above eating thralls in lean times, or when the slaves have outlived their usefulness. More successful frost giant tribes sometimes capture hardier creatures such as ice trolls or ogres as thralls&mdash;these fare somewhat better, serving as shock troops in the giants' war bands.</p><p>One of the few labors the giants take pride in is crafting weapons and armor. They manufacture excellent chain armor, which they prefer to plate, as plate makes noise and has joints that can freeze. For weaponry, they favor enormous greataxes, sometimes hafted with whole trees.</p><p>Frost giants enjoy the company of creatures as brutal as themselves, and so take in other tundra creatures as exotic \"pets.\" They favor winter wolves, but frost worms, mammoths, polar bears, svathurims, and yetis are not unknown.</p><p>The vast majority of frost giants worship ancient giant deities of blood, ice, and war. The giants dedicate their battles to these gods out of respect, and appease them with sacrifices of slaves and treasure out of fear. More recently, some tribes have turned to the worship of demon lords of brutality, vengeance, and the deadly cold. This has caused something of a schism: the traditionalists accuse the demon-worshipers of turning their backs on their progenitors and becoming thralls to undeserving masters. Yet in truth, most frost giants will worship any god who caters to their desires.</p><p>Full statistics for frost giants can be found in their &lt;i&gt;Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; entry.</p>",
