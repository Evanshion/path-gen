Targeted creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or take 1d6 points of cold damage. Unattended objects cannot attempt a saving throw. Creatures damaged by the spell must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage.</p><p>This feat doesn't grant an actual gaze attack&mdash;foes and allies are not in danger simply by meeting your gaze.</p>",
