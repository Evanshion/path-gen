    "body": "When charging, running, or taking a double move, a svathurim can stride across open air as if it were using air walk . This movement is very taxing; a svathurim must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution check at the end of each round it uses this ability or become fatigued for 1 minute. This DC increases by 2 for each round after the first. Returning to the ground resets the DC to 14, but doesn't negate any ongoing fatigue or exhaustion. A svathurim cannot trample when using this ability.",
