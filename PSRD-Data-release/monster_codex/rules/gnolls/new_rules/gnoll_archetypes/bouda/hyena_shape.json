    "body": "<p id=\"hyena-shape\">At 10th level, a bouda gains the ability to turn into a hyena or dire hyena and back again a number of times per day equal to her Intelligence modifier. This ability functions as <i>beast shape II</i>, except for the following. The effect lasts for 1 hour per witch level, or until the bouda changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 20th level, a bouda can change her form at will. If a bouda dies while in hyena shape, she does not revert back to her true form.</p><p>The bouda does not lose the ability to speak while in animal form, and can communicate with hyenas and dire hyenas as if under the effects of <i>speak with animals</i> . Furthermore, while in this form, the bouda gains the benefit of the Natural Spell feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.</p><p>This ability replaces the major hex granted at 10th level.</p>",
