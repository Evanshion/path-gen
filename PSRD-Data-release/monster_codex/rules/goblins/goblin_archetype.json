Instead, a goblin alchemist's formula book is filled with smears of various fluids, pictures representing materials needed, and other scent-, taste-, or pictograph-based representations of his formulae. Goblin alchemists can learn each other's formulae as easily as other alchemists learn language-based formulae.</p><p>A literate alchemist can learn formulae from a goblin alchemist's book, but he must spend 1 day studying a formula (instead of 1 hour), and the Spellcraft DC to successfully learn it is equal to 20 + the formula's level (instead of 15 + the formula's level). This otherwise works like copying a formula from another alchemist's formula book.</p><p>Goblins cannot learn formulae from scrolls or language-based books, but can be taught a new formula by an alchemist or wizard who spends 1 day verbally explaining it.</p>",
