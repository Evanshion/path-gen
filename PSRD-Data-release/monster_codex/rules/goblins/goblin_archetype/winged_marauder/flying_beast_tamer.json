    "body": "<p>At 1st level, a winged marauder acquires a flying mount as an animal companion. This works as the druid animal companion class feature, except the marauder must select a dire bat or giant vulture. The marauder's effective druid level is equal to his alchemist level. A marauder and his companion don't gain the share spells ability. This ability replaces the mutagen and persistent mutagen class features.</p>",
