The fur of an yzobu is long and shaggy, protecting it from the harsh winters of its habitat.

A single herd can range over a spread of tens of thousands of square miles in a year, devouring all the grass and small vegetation in the region, trampling what they can't eat, and forcing other creatures&mdash;including humanoids&mdash;to move elsewhere or suffer the same fate.</p>",
