    "body": "<p>At 10th level, a grenadier's bombs become particularly overwhelming when they explode. Whenever a grenadier confirms a critical hit with a bomb, the creature directly struck by that bomb is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw (DC equals the bomb's Reflex save DC to avoid splash damage) reduces the duration to 1 round. The effects of this ability stack with a frost bomb's staggering effect, but not with the effects of the Staggering Critical feat. Additional critical hits with bombs add to any duration remaining from previous ones. This ability replaces poison immunity.</p>",
