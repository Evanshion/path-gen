            "body": "<p>Creatures of deep, dark places, kobolds are masters of tunneling, mining, and setting traps. They despise those that would take advantage their relative physical weakness or steal the precious ores they mine, and thus devote themselves to creating elaborate mechanical defenses for their lairs. Adventurers attempting to storm a kobold den rarely see an actual kobold until after they've been assaulted by a wide variety of cleverly engineered cruelties. </p><p>All kobolds claim to be related to dragons, yet while it's true that kobold scale colors often match those of chromatic dragons, dragons themselves don't reciprocate this feeling of kinship. A kobold who manages to convince a dragon of her worth often serves it as a clever trap-maker or flunky, in exchange for the honor and protection the dragon's presence affords.</p><p>When humanoids and kobolds mix, often as a result of mining operations, kobolds often get a reputation as thieves and nuisances because of their tendency to appear at night and abscond with anything the humans leave lying around. Anything from farming equipment to small animals is seen as fair game to kobolds, who argue that such confiscation is not theft, but rather simply making good use of items the humans clearly don't value properly.</p><p>As creatures of deep caverns and shadowed forests, kobolds have difficulty with light, and even a torch is uncomfortably bright to their eyes. Hence, though they are not naturally nocturnal, they rarely venture to the surface during the day.</p><p>Kobold settlements are elaborate affairs. Though the lairs are relatively small&mdash;generally comprising a few caverns that serve as living quarters, larders, and workshops&mdash;each lair is surrounded by a complex web of tunnels and crawlspaces, all packed with ingenious traps. To kobolds, the best battle is the one they never have to fight at all, so creating new traps is a constant (if somewhat paranoid) policy and pastime in kobold society.</p><p>Tied into this paranoia is kobolds' treatment of egg chambers. The average kobold has no idea where his tribes' eggs are stored until hatching&mdash;preventing him from revealing the location even under coercive or magical interrogation. Only the tribe's chieftain and the kobolds assigned to watch over the eggs know the truth, ensuring that if the tribe's complex is eventually overrun (seen as an inevitability by the fatalistic kobolds), enough eggs will survive to raise a new generation.</p><p>Kobolds' resentment of larger races burns fiercest toward dwarves, gnomes, and other races who tend to mine the mineral veins the kobolds consider theirs. Once a kobold tribe begins digging out precious metals or gems in an area, its members feel that anyone else digging in the same area is a thief. Even if a kobold mining operation accidentally breaks into an established dwarven city, the kobolds' sense of manifest destiny would likely lead them to see the dwarves as the interlopers.</p><p>Yet the resentment kobolds feel toward other races is nothing compared to their animosity toward other kobold tribes that intrude on their mining operations or partake of the food sources their tribe considers its own. The resulting wars are fierce, bloody, and swift, with both tribes attempting to slay as many opponents as possible until one chief dies. Once a tribe has lost its chief, the losing tribe's demoralized survivors become slaves to the victorious tribe, and are sent into the mines to harvest out all the minerals they can for their new masters. If adventurers manage to make it through a tribe's traps, it's inevitably these same slaves who are armed and sent to confront the threat, generally with little hope of winning the ensuing battle. Though some might wonder why kobolds condemned in this way don't turn on their masters, the sad truth is that those who want to rebel are usually cut down before their attempt gets off the ground.</p><p>Most kobold tribes are led by a single chieftain, whose authority is rarely questioned. If a kobold tribe is ruled by a non-kobold, such as a young dragon, a kobold chief is still in charge of carrying out the ruler's instructions and seeing to day-to-day administration. Chieftainship is usually decided through combat, though accidents involving traps are tacitly considered fair game.</p><p>Kobolds worship the dragon gods, and in many cases dragons themselves, seeing little difference between all-powerful deities and (to them) essentially all-powerful dragons. The dragons themselves tend to enjoy the constant, obsequious worship of their lesser cousins&mdash;though the occasional solitude-loving dragon may decide that a kobold supplicant makes a better meal than a servant&mdash;and kobolds' naturally ordered and hierarchical society makes it easy for a creature at the top to command them.</p><p>Although kobolds feel a particular kinship with chromatic dragons and have less affinity for metallic ones, kobold scale colors are not nearly as personality-defining as those of true dragons, though some tribes have superstitions and other beliefs about scale color. Color is inconsistent in kobold genes, and parents of one color may give birth to children of several different scale hues, leading to a full spectrum of the chromatic tones that have little or no correlation to abilities.</p><p>The few metallic-colored kobolds are an exception to this rule. Though no more good-inclined than their fellows, these metallic kobolds are seen as special or marked by some higher power, and often go on to become great chiefs or shamans. Of course, this marking is a double-edged sword, as not every chief wants a potential usurper hanging around, and even those tribes who seek honestly to make use of their \"blessed\" members may subject them to a battery of dangerous tests in order to ascertain what powers these individuals might possess.</p><p>Full statistics for kobolds can be found in their &lt;i&gt;Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; entry.</p>",

The exiled kyranas then split up and wander the surrounding tunnels, traveling hundreds of miles in search of any source of heat.
