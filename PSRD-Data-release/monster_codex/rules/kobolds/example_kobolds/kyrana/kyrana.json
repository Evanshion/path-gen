As soon as the creatures reach adulthood at the age of 18 months, however, the parents turn on their offspring and drive them from the nest. The exiled kyranas then split up and wander the surrounding tunnels, traveling hundreds of miles in search of any source of heat. That means they often come waddling into inhabited areas, snorting and ready to burn anyone standing between them and the hearth. Adventurers may find their campfires claimed by a greedy kyrana, or end up being followed for their torchlight. Kobolds often use these barely intelligent dragons as heavy artillery, employing fire arrows and flaming traps to lure them into conflict with enemies.</p>",
