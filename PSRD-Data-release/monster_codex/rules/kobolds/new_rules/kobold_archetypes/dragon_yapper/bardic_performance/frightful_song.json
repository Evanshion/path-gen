    "body": "<p> : A dragon yapper of 8th level or higher can amplify his voice to sound like an actual dragon. Enemies within 30 feet become shaken unless they succeed at a Will save (DC 10 +1/2 the dragon yapper's level + the dragon yapper's Charisma modifier). A successful save renders targets immune to this ability for 24 hours. Frightful song is a mind-affecting ability, and a fear effect that uses audible components. This performance replaces dirge of doom.</p>",
