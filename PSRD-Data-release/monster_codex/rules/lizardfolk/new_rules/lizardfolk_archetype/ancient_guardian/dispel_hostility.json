    "body": "<p id=\"dispel-hostility\">An ancient guardian doesn't gain spontaneous casting at 1st level. Instead, at 3rd level, she can channel stored spell energy into a spell capable of dispelling hostile thoughts and strong emotions. She can \"lose\" a prepared spell in order to cast <i>calm emotions</i> . Instead of the normal Will saving throw for that spell, the DC of a <i>calm emotions</i> spell cast with this ability is 10 + 1/2 the ancient guardian's druid level + her Wisdom modifier. This ability replaces spontaneous casting.</p>",
