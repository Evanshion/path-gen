    "body": "<p id=\"undo-artifice\">At 13th level, an ancient guardian gains the ability to reduce a nonliving item to its component raw materials. This acts as the spell <i>polymorph any object, </i> but works on magical or nonmagical nonliving objects. The duration is always permanent. Unlike <i>polymorph any object</i>, this ability can't be used to mimic the effects of other spells. Items subject to this effect receive a Fortitude saving throw to negate the effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the ancient guardian's druid level + her Wisdom modifier). Magic items receive a circumstance bonus on this save equal to +1 for every 5,000 gp of the item's value. An ancient guardian can use undo artifice a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier. This ability replaces a thousand faces.</p>",
