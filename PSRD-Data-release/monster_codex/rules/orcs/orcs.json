    "body": "<p>Every child old enough to pick up a stick and pretend it's a sword has imagined swinging it at an orc and lopping off the imaginary foe's head. The foul creatures are so ubiquitous that every farm and village in every corner of the world has heard some tale of the green-skinned marauders sweeping down from the hills or bubbling up out of the deep places of the earth to overrun the land and destroy everything in their path.</p><p>Orcs are brutish humanoids, typically only slightly larger than humans but with much more muscle mass. They are base, squabbling creatures, living in squalor and fighting among themselves as much as with the civilized races. Orcs live by a simple code: the strong take from the weak&mdash;by force if possible. The surly savages delight in their own raw, animalistic natures, brutalizing everything they can, including themselves. They breed like vermin, so life is cheap. They live for the sake of battle and pillage, regarding the whole world as theirs for the taking. Fortunately for everyone else, orcs are usually too disorganized to realize this fantasy.</p><p>Bestial and heavily muscled, orcs stand roughly 6 feet tall. Their skin ranges in hue from dark green to sallow pink to grayish, and their coarse hair is usually black. Their teeth resemble the ferocious tusks of wild boars. Their blood-red eyes burn with hatred, and are so sensitive to light that the creatures shrink from the harsh glare of the sun, much preferring to remain in dark, subterranean places or to roam about at night.</p><p>Orcs are fond of war paint and ritual scarification, and frequently mark themselves with both before battle. They love to claim trophies, particularly the heads of enemies, which they use to adorn their camps or villages. Orcs tend to wear crude, poorly assembled clothing and use shoddy tools and weapons, though powerful combatants often don well-made armor and fight with finely crafted blades&mdash;both usually stolen on raids or from slain enemies.</p><p>Orcs have short life spans in comparison to many other humanoid races, rarely living 40 years, even if they don't die in battle first. They make up for this deficit in years through incessant breeding, and the fact that female orcs often give birth to multiple offspring with each pregnancy means that there's always a fresh supply of young orcs waiting in the wings to round out an orc warlord's armies. Orcs aren't terribly particular about who they mate with, making half-breeds a common presence within orc societies.</p><p>Orcs hate just about every other race they have encountered&mdash;they feel scorn and derision toward those they perceive as weaker than themselves, and resent the power more formidable races wield over them. They are fond of bullying smaller creatures, such as goblins and kobolds, and feel superior to humans, elves, and dwarves despite the never-ending struggle to conquer these groups' lands. Creatures held prisoner by orcs suffer terribly, and if they're lucky, they don't survive for long. Those who are captured rather than immediately slain often end up as slaves, and are either sold to outsiders or forced to serve their original orc captors until they drop dead from exhaustion. Many prisoners are eaten by their captors, while others serve as entertainment for the orcs, thrown into fighting pits where the best they can hope for is to die in battle against wild beasts or other slaves.</p><p>Orcs are bullies by nature, and every aspect of their society revolves around the idea that might makes right. An orc leader attains her position of power through intimidation and brute force, taking on challengers and defeating them in personal combat. Orcs respect a warlord or chieftain who has the battle scars to prove her mettle, but only until a younger, stronger upstart rises up to take the elder's place. When an orc is low in the pecking order, he often finds others even weaker than himself to lord over. Other humanoids, particularly goblins and prisoners captured in war, bear the brunt of weaker orcs' savagery.</p><p>Even the chieftains of different tribes jockey with one another for supremacy during times of great orc uprisings. The right to lead a powerful orc army to battle is often earned over many days of feasting, drinking, and ritual combat, and a great many hordes have fallen apart when blood matches between tribal leaders resulted in the deaths of both chiefs. More than a few orc tribes hold long-standing grudges against one another due to the murder of great chiefs and the consequent lost opportunities to invade civilized lands.</p><p>Because orcs hate sunlight, their communities are often found underground in sprawling networks of caverns and tunnels. They are known to claim vast complexes built by other races&mdash;particularly those of dwarves&mdash;as their own, and are difficult to root out. When they do dwell on the surface, orcs try to find locations that are sheltered from the sun, taking refuge in deep forests or narrow canyons. Occasionally, orcs lay claim to war-torn cities of surface dwellers, using the shelter of buildings and sewer systems to avoid the painful glare of daylight.</p><p>Most orcs care little for the mysteries of magic or unworldly questions of religion, with the exception of orc mystics and witch doctors. Like orc warriors, orc mystics and witch doctors earn their places in orc society through brutality and intimidation, and warlords and chieftains are usually wise enough to value those who exhibit the rare skill and prowess to commune with supernatural forces&mdash;as long as it helps these leaders stay on top of the pack.</p><p>Full statistics for orcs can be found in their &lt;i&gt;Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; entry.</p>",
