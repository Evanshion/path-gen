It can do this a number of times per day equal to its Constitution modifier. Alternatively, a kirrix can expend two uses of this ability to spray a disease in a 15-foot cone, exposing all creatures in the cone to the disease even if it can't normally be contracted by contact. Doing so depletes the kirrix's reserve of that disease.",

            "body": "A kirrix's body has innate features that let it clean up and contain diseases within ratfolk warrens. A kirrix collects diseases by consuming them off of objects or from the air (typically contact, ingested, or inhaled diseases), by ministering to a diseased creature (typically ingested or injury diseases), or by fighting a creature that imparts diseases and being subjected to one. The kirrix can store up to two types of diseases at a time in an organ near its throat. (A typical kirrix has filth fever and bubonic plague stored.) A kirrix can harmlessly digest an unwanted disease as a full-round action. If the creature consumes a mold or another substance that causes disease, it clears the surface of disease. If it ingests a diseased creature's blood (either by licking an open wound or biting the creature), it can produce an antiplague secretion, which it can use on itself or apply to others. Treat this as though the kirrix were using the Heal skill to treat disease with a +12 bonus.",
