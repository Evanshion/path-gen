    "body": "<p>When applied to the nose as a standard action, this alchemical paste traps airborne particles and sharpens your olfactory receptors, heightening your sense of smell. You gain the scent ability, except you can detect creatures and odors at only half the distance. If you already have the scent ability, rhinarium paste increases the range at which you can detect creatures by 50%. Rhinarium paste's effects lasts for 1 hour. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.</p>",
