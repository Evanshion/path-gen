They aren't powerful individually, but their large collectives give them both strength in numbers and the constant support of their families and loved ones. Though ratfolk can subdue enemies by swarming in combat, the greater threat comes from their inventiveness and collections of dangerous trinkets.</p><p>The typical ratfolk must withstand a riot of conflicting desires that result from generations of communal living, keen intellects, and lives spent adapting to a multitude of environments. Ratfolk are short-lived but populous; many ratfolk pregnancies result in twins or triplets, so warrens can grow very quickly if provided a steady supply of food and economic opportunities. Yet despite their large populations, ratfolk warrens tend to be relatively compact. This is more a matter of choice than necessity, as the creatures are naturally gregarious and enjoy the company of others, including rats and similar rodents&mdash;which ratfolk's natural empathy allows them to handle with ease. Although ratfolk respect other cultures' concepts of personal space, among their own kind, they think little of squeezing past one another, crowding into a small space, or clambering over family members with little warning.</p><p>Ratfolk have highly developed brains that quickly process, memorize, and analyze new information. In particular, ratfolk have exceptional spatial reasoning, understanding of causality, and raw curiosity. These traits not only enable them to predict how a material or device might change when manipulated in a particular way, but also encourage them to experiment unceasingly in times of peril and plenty. Although ratfolk live a meager fraction of the time that a human does, few of them fret about their brief lifespans; instead, they make up for it by spending much of their \"idle\" time exploring, experimenting, and experiencing what life has to offer.</p><p>This eagerness to explore also manifests in ratfolk's relationships with each other, for even though each member values the community, she also endeavors to distinguish herself through her own accomplishments. The constant bustle of ratfolk pursuing their own projects creates a chaotic environment, yet despite their seemingly self-absorbed motivations, ratfolk research and tinker with the intention of using their inventions to strengthen the community and give it an edge in survival. They praise the achievements of individuals, and it is considered good manners for the one celebrated to recognize the host of others who helped her accomplish her goal, reinforcing the community's bonds.</p><p>Ratfolk names are often short&mdash;a necessity when families are large and an adult must call out many names at once. If several ratfolk in a community have the same name, which is not uncommon, they're differentiated via nicknames. To further distinguish themselves, ratfolk wear unique jewelry or clothing with distinctive embroidery, or they may apply modest amounts of perfume to stand out.</p><p>Outside the warren, ratfolk make a living through trade, and their demeanors change: the playfulness fades in favor of businesslike professionalism, and their curiosity and skills of observation are used to study those with whom they trade. They take care to observe cultural taboos and traditions wherever they go, and sometimes cover themselves so as not to discourage closed-minded customers. A trade caravan might travel for a year or more before returning to the warren. Embarking on a trade mission is an exciting prospect for younger ratfolk, who use the experience as an unofficial rite of passage as well as a chance to study other races' technology. It is not uncommon for a handful of ratfolk to leave the caravan along the way in search of local opportunities.</p><p>The nearly incomprehensible bustle of a crowded warren belies the race's capacity to operate in an organized fashion. An outside threat quickly mobilizes ratfolk to defend their home. Warrens tend to be a jumble of narrow tunnels that connect larger living spaces, and defenders can fend off large numbers of attackers at strategic choke points. Years of living cheek by jowl allow ratfolk to fight in close proximity without interfering with one another; in fact, intruders often find it difficult to defend against the unpredictable attacks of a swarm of the small humanoids. Tunnels typically have easily removable supports near the warren so the ratfolk can collapse some entrances when attacked. As many of the adults hold off the attackers, others uncover escape routes and shepherd the young, sick, and weak to safety.</p><p>Despite their high population density, ratfolk settlements are kept remarkably clean. It is unclear whether the cleanliness or scientific understanding came first, but ratfolk alchemists have an excellent understanding of disease and how it spreads, leading to the development of complex sanitation procedures that reduce the risk of a plague sweeping through the crowded populace. This meticulousness does not always translate into organization, though, and an immaculately clean workshop might still be a jumble of tools, half-finished projects, and esoteric blueprints.</p><p>Ratfolk love to accumulate baubles, devices, and other small but exciting treasures. They place particularly high value on shiny objects&mdash;especially adornments like rings&mdash;and delicate mechanisms that can be disassembled, studied, and then pieced back together. Ratfolk practice a system of loose ownership in which one may borrow another's possession so long as it is returned when asked and taking it would not endanger its owner. This detachment makes ratfolk willing to trade away even prized possessions so long as doing so means gaining something even better. Ratfolk's love of shiny things illustrates another contradiction&mdash;while they delight in radiance, they favor living in dark places. A sparkling trinket is certain to fascinate ratfolk, but a bright flash of light or unexpected glow unsettles them.</p><p>Full statistics for ratfolk can be found in their &lt;i&gt;Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; entry.</p>",
