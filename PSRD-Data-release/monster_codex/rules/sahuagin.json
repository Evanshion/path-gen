            "body": "<p>The sahuagin are horrid creatures that lurk in the oceans, ever ready to wreak devastation. These \"sea devils\" leave ships adrift and crewless, steal away whole villages in the dead of night, and force aquatic elves and merfolk alike to gird for war.</p><p>Sahuagin are complex beings. They have keen intellects and crave order and structure, yet they boil with barely suppressed rage and bloodlust. Even the smallest provocation can tip a sahuagin from cold and calculating schemer to murderous assailant. To stay sane and sharp in times of need, sahuagin periodically revel in bloodstained waters&mdash;those who can't satiate their bloodlust either retreat into lethargic apathy or snap and turn against their own.</p><p>As a people, sahuagin seek nothing less than total domination of the seas. Though they love to unleash doom on other intelligent species, sahuagin also live in perpetual war with their own kind. Their kings and queens encourage these petty blood feuds, seeing them as a means to feed the blood frenzy, control their numbers, and further hone their race's already considerable skills in battle.</p><p>Unlike most aquatic humanoids, sahuagin thrive at any depth or temperature. Even still, they show a marked preference for warm coastal waters&mdash;perhaps due to an abundance of both food and beings to terrorize. Sahuagin can be found anywhere from sheltered atolls to lightless trenches, from the tropics to the poles. They have even spread to the Elemental Plane of Water.</p><p>Sahuagin live under a feudal system that embodies a ruthless enforcement of order. Each sahuagin holds a position earned with its prowess and skills, and risks demotion by showing any sign of incompetence&mdash;or death for any sign of weakness. Officers and lords rule minor holdings as vassals to the barons, dukes, and princesses; kings and queens rule entire oceans from their grand palaces within cities boasting populations in the tens of thousands. Each noble sahuagin aspires to bend the others to her will and become the ruler of an oceanic empire, ushering in the inevitable age of sahuagin ascendance.</p><p>Despite their use of noble titles, sahuagin put little stock in bloodlines. Accomplishment trumps parentage, and while sahuagin take pride in relatives with influence and strength, even the offspring of royals must swim unaided. Certainly those children have more opportunities and training than others, but the ambitious daughter of a common laborer might rise to rule a barony, while the inept son of a baron could very well become the meal of his betters.</p><p>Sahuagin view other creatures through the lens of their appetites&mdash;other races live only to serve as slaves, to die in sport or battle, or to fill the belly. Sahuagin rarely ally with creatures other than their beloved sharks and the shark-like adaros, though they occasionally enslave dragon turtles and other fearsome aquatic monsters as beasts of war. They despise aquatic elves, locathahs, merfolk, and tritons, seeing them as weaklings fit only for slavery and feasting. Aboleths and krakens earn a mixture of loathing and respect, as these beings represent the greatest impediment to sahuagin dominion of the seas.</p><p>Young sahuagin are born into clutches of up to 200 eggs, which females lay in well-protected egg chambers. A single settlement typically has one chamber, but larger cities can have up to a dozen. Eggs hatch 3 months after being laid, spawning eel-like fingerlings&mdash;all teeth, jaws, and tail. Hatching provokes a violent frenzy, as the newborn fingerlings devour the smaller and weaker members of their clutch. A number of the survivors fall prey to larger predators, or are eaten by their larger siblings when they grow hungry again after their brutal first meal. Only the clever, fast, or strong survive long in the egg chambers.</p><p>Sahuagin parents return to claim their surviving young after a year has passed, recognizing their offspring by scent. Some young remain unclaimed, because their parents either have perished or cannot track down the scent. The sahuagin barracks raise such foundlings communally, thrusting them into battle as soon as they can wield a trident.</p><p>Sahuagin mature quickly. They develop arms and legs at 6 months of age, grow to around 5 feet tall within a year, and reach their adult size of 7 feet tall around their sixth year. Upon reaching maturity, sahuagin of low social standing must fend for themselves or die&mdash;those of higher status are often trained and protected long enough by their parents to become skilled and deadly warriors.</p><p>As a species, sahuagin are particularly prone to mutation. Most mutants perish in the hatcheries, but those that survive command early respect, their strange abilities seen as proof of divine favor. The most common are the fearsome four-armed sahuagin, perhaps accounting for one in 100 surviving hatchlings. Other mutations appear to arise due to environmental conditions or nearness to other species, or perhaps in response to trace contaminants in the water. Of particular note are the malenti, those sahuagin who for unknown reasons are born looking exactly like aquatic elves.</p><p>Sahuagin have long, possibly unlimited life spans, though violence claims most before they reach their thirtieth year. Some particularly fierce princes and queens have ruled for hundreds of years, however, as sahuagin's bodies don't decline with age. Particularly old sahuagin are significantly larger than their younger kin (growing into Large creatures as they age). Sahuagin of all ages despise infirmity, and attempt to excise it from their midst with atavistic, violent reactions.</p><p>Full statistics for sahuagin can be found in their &lt;i&gt;Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; entry.</p>",
