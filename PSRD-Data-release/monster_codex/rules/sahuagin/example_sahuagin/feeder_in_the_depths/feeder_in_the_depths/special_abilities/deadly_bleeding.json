    "body": "A feeder in the depth's bite causes bleeding wounds that resist healing. The first bite that damages a creature deals 1d4 points of bleed damage, and each subsequent bite increases the amount of bleed by 1d4. Stopping the bleeding requires a successful DC 20 Heal check or the application of any magical healing. However, anyone attempting to cast a healing spell on a creature suffering from deadly bleeding must succeed at a DC 20 caster level check or the spell doesn't affect the bleeding creature. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
