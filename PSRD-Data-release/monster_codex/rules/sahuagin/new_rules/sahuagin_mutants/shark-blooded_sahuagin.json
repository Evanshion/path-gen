    "body": "<p>These sahuagin mutants have overly large maws filled with rows of shark-like teeth, as well as the fins and tail of an oversized shark. These abnormalities give them the appearance of monstrous merfolk, a base speed of 5 feet, a swim speed of 80 feet, a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, and immunity to trip attempts. Shark-blooded sahuagin are typically found in sahuagin communities with an unusually high number of shark guardians or near shark breeding grounds.</p>",
