    "body": "<p>These pallid, sickly looking sahuagin lack eyes, but their blindsense increases to 90 feet and they gain Blind Fight as a bonus feat. A glowing tendril protruding from a sightless sahuagin causes all sighted creatures to be dazzled while within 10 feet of the sahuagin, and allows it to use <i>animal trance</i> once per day as a spell-like ability. This <i>animal trance</i> effect is entirely visual, so it doesn't have the sonic descriptor or work on blind creatures. As sightless sahuagin are blind, they are immune to all sight-based effects and attacks, including gaze attacks. Isolated sightless sahuagin mutants arise near sites of ancient evil, and make even other sahuagin uneasy. Whole tribes of such mutants dwell in deep underwater trenches and caves, lost cities at the bottom of oceans, and cursed aquatic temples.</p>",
