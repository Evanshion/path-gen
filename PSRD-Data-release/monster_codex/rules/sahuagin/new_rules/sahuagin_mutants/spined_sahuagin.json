    "body": "<p>Covered in hundreds of needlelike spines, spined sahuagin can raise their piercing protrusions to impale creatures that touch them. Any creature that successfully grapples or is grappled by a spined sahuagin, or hits one with an unarmed strike or natural weapon, takes 1d4 points of piercing damage. Additionally, these mutants gain Defensive Combat Training and Improved Grapple as bonus feats. Spined sahuagin most commonly appear in depths that also serve as the hunting grounds of sea serpents, thalassic behemoths, or other massive aquatic predators.</p>",
