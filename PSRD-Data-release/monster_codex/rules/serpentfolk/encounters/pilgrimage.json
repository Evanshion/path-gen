    "body": "<p>Religion motivates many serpentfolk as they follow the strange dreams and visions provided by their half-dead snake-god&mdash;their deity charging them to make war upon all other races. Battlefields and holy sites often draw such pilgrims, who perform frenzied acts of bloodletting and feeding in an effort to appease their patron. A bone prophet typically leads these sojourns, accompanied by a handful of priests and degenerate serpentfolk to act as bodyguards and enforcers.</p>",
