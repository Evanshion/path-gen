Spies often stake out powerful priests and arcanists, posing as fellow scholars or simple servitors, in order to gain access to knowledge and arcane lore not readily available in their subterranean caverns. Given their long life spans and reptilian patience, these individuals may infiltrate an organization and stay implanted there for years, waiting for a choice artifact or tome to present itself.
