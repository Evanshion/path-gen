    "body": "<p>Of all the subterranean horrors known to the civilized races, few inspire as much fear and horror as the venomous serpentfolk. These cold-blooded, wholly evil reptilian masters forged a long-lasting empire on a foundation of relentless conquest, slavery, and arcane power. Driven by arrogance and avarice, they waged war in the name of their slithering god, subjugating subterranean creatures and surface dwellers alike. However, the rise of mammalian humanoids eventually gave the serpentfolk pause. History tells of the titanic struggles carried out between the serpentfolk and the greatest of humanity's progeny, a battle first waged on the sunlit surface world before it plumbed the depths of its darkest recesses.</p><p>At the climax of these wars, a cataclysmic event shook the pillars of the serpentfolk empire, severing their connection to their god and casting them into disarray. The serpentfolk were driven into retreat. Their brooding leaders went into hibernation in deep, dark holds as a strategy for outliving and outlasting their enemies. But with the passage of generations and centuries, the still-active serpentfolk guarding these strongholds devolved into degenerate brutes, only occasionally giving birth to a highborn example of their original greatness&mdash;further emphasizing the race's humiliating descent from its once noble heights. Now, their true champions slumber in ageless hibernation, waiting for the day when humanity undergoes its own decline so the serpentfolk can seize power once again.</p><p>As a race, the serpentfolk have undergone a radical transformation since the height of their lost empire. The waning of their snake-god's influence caused a sharp distinction to manifest in the original \"purecaste\" specimens (those with the advanced serpentfolk template), giving birth to the more commonly encountered \"degenerate\" serpentfolk. Yet, the twin strains within the overall race continue to intersect&mdash;a purecaste serpentfolk of genius intelligence might result from a pairing of degenerate brutes, just as a purecaste might give birth to more monstrous offspring. Regardless, all serpentfolk share a common bond, with purecastes leveraging the strengths of the degenerates to ensure their mutual survival.</p><p>On average, the typical purecaste serpentfolk stands a bit taller than its degenerate ilk at 5 to 7 feet in height, but is also far slimmer at around 100 to 140 pounds. The more powerfully built degenerate serpentfolk stands between 4 and 6 feet tall, but weighs as much as 180 to 220 pounds. The scales of all serpentfolk display a wide variety of colors and patterns, and some individuals paint themselves with pigments and cosmetics.</p><p>Serpentfolk are quite long-lived, generally reaching 500 years of age. Even so, they face a number of obstacles to returning its civilization to the heights it once enjoyed. Aside from the prevalence of degenerate offspring, most serpentfolk mate only once or twice during their lifetimes. Each mating produces as many as a dozen live births or fertile eggs up to a year later&mdash;live births now being the majority, although in ancient times egg-laying was more common&mdash;and it takes 50 years for offspring to reach adulthood. This infrequent fertility and long maturation period mean the serpentfolk are fighting an uphill battle against a dwindling population. This leads their society to lean heavily on the use of mind-controlled slaves to run the empire, especially the more dangerous tasks like mining and construction.</p><p>The diet of the serpentfolk is mostly meat&mdash;with \"lesser\" sentient creatures being considered a particular delicacy&mdash;along with strange fruits harvested from subterranean plants to aid digestion. Serpentfolk gorge themselves when they eat&mdash;a sensuous act kept private except for the most frenzied of feedings during major holidays and hosted events. Typically, serpentfolk dine only once per month, devouring 80 to 100 pounds of food before taking a couple of days to digest the meal. However, they can go as long as 4 months without eating at all, and some do so as part of a purifying religious experience or in preparation for complex arcane rituals.</p><p>To a serpentfolk, all creatures incapable of telepathy are lesser beings, animals fit only for use as slaves or food. Serpentfolk enclaves exist in near silence while its members communicate and debate telepathically with one another. Morally, serpentfolk have no compass except that which motivates them to action. Self-interest reigns in most matters, but serpentfolk prove incredibly efficient when uniting in common purpose. Such situations usually involve the promise of an equal reward from the spoils of war and the arcane lore gained through victory. Devout serpentfolk still rally to the cause of their snake-god, eager to restore the race to the heights it once knew. Should the serpentfolk succeed, their most powerful scions will emerge from hibernation to lead a new era of conquest and subjugation against the surface world.</p><p>Within their own culture, purecaste serpentfolk keep to themselves; each lives alone rather than sharing a living space with others of its kind, seeking to amass as much knowledge and capability as possible in its lifetime. Purecaste serpentfolk avoid emotional attachments to other creatures, including their own offspring. Males and females pair only for the purpose of mating, and then separate to pursue individual interests. Likewise, they form no bonds with the animals or slaves they keep, viewing such creatures as tools or commodities.</p><p>Purecaste serpentfolk value sensual experiences and intellectual challenges. They delight in taking that which they desire, and often challenge one another to duels or gamble their prized slaves through deadly games as a form of entertainment.</p><p>Full statistics for serpentfolk can be found in their &lt;i&gt;Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; entry.</p>",

            "body": "<p>At the height of their conflict with humanity, the serpentfolk developed an especially devious technique for cloaking their agents in impenetrable disguises to assist them in infiltrating the enemy. By enduring a bath of alchemical oils in specially prepared incubation tanks, serpentfolk volunteers would engage in a form of ritual suicide that sheds their skins and grants a form made of human flesh. This irreversible process only works on purecaste serpentfolk, and functions as <i>reincarnate</i> with the shape of the new body specifically chosen to be human rather than determined randomly. These \"reborn\" serpentfolk then insinuate themselves into human society, acting as sleeper agents and spies to enable the growth and success of the serpentfolk empire.</p><p>Survivors of this ritual always retain the serpentfolk intellect, including the serpentfolk's racial bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, as well as their spell-like abilities, telepathy, and immunity to mind-affecting effects. The recipient's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change according to its new race (human) as described in the <i>reincarnate</i> spell. Although they resemble humans, these reborn serpentfolk are not fertile except with other serpentfolk, and a careful examination of internal organs of one of these creatures reveals its inhuman nature.</p>",
