    "body": "<p>At the height of their conflict with humanity, the serpentfolk developed an especially devious technique for cloaking their agents in impenetrable disguises to assist them in infiltrating the enemy. By enduring a bath of alchemical oils in specially prepared incubation tanks, serpentfolk volunteers would engage in a form of ritual suicide that sheds their skins and grants a form made of human flesh. This irreversible process only works on purecaste serpentfolk, and functions as <i>reincarnate</i> with the shape of the new body specifically chosen to be human rather than determined randomly. These \"reborn\" serpentfolk then insinuate themselves into human society, acting as sleeper agents and spies to enable the growth and success of the serpentfolk empire.</p><p>Survivors of this ritual always retain the serpentfolk intellect, including the serpentfolk's racial bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, as well as their spell-like abilities, telepathy, and immunity to mind-affecting effects. The recipient's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change according to its new race (human) as described in the <i>reincarnate</i> spell. Although they resemble humans, these reborn serpentfolk are not fertile except with other serpentfolk, and a careful examination of internal organs of one of these creatures reveals its inhuman nature.</p>",
