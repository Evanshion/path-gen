If the creature fails, it becomes slowed for 1 round. At the end of that round, the creature is no longer slowed, but it must succeed at a second saving throw or it becomes petrified for 1d4 rounds.</p>",

It has no benefits for a creature that doesn't have the stench special ability. While a creature wears this amulet, its stench aura is suppressed. Once per hour as a standard action, the creature can spray a brown slime from its mouth in a 30-foot cone. Any creature hit by the slime must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened for the same duration. The save DC and duration are the same as those of the wearer's stench aura.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Furthermore, the floor in the cone becomes coated in the slick slime for 1 minute. This has the same effects as coating a solid surface with a <i>grease</i> spell (DC 11), but doesn't require creatures to attempt saving throws if they're in the area when the cone is created&mdash;only if they move through the area.</p>",
