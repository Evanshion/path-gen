    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A <i>cave dweller's greataxe</i> appears to be a thin slab of stone crudely lashed to a bone haft. It's as serviceable as a metal weapon of the same type would be, and functions as a <i>+1 greataxe</i> . Once per day when the wielder of a <i>cave dweller's greataxe</i> hits a creature, the wielder can speak a command word to force the hit creature to attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save. If the creature fails, it becomes slowed for 1 round. At the end of that round, the creature is no longer slowed, but it must succeed at a second saving throw or it becomes petrified for 1d4 rounds.</p>",
