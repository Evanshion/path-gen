These ancient troglodytes went into hiding in the deep places of the world, and though many of them perished, fled to other planes, or retreated into lichdom, a few sought refuge in magical stasis. Over the long centuries, troglodyte paragons have from time to time awakened from their magical slumber. Though some have sought out modern troglodytes in an effort to elevate them and reclaim the glory of their lost civilization, most troglodyte paragons despise their degenerate descendants. Distinguished from common troglodytes by their glowing, emerald eyes and gold-tinged scales, troglodyte paragons are long-lived, with maximum lifespans averaging 400 years. Troglodyte paragons are extremely paranoid and obsessed with self-preservation. Most troglodyte paragons have class levels in cleric or sorcerer.</p><p>Troglodyte paragons are Large troglodytes with 7 Hit Dice. Their natural armor bonus increases by 2, their claw attacks deal 1d8 points of damage, and their bite attacks deal 1d6 points of damage. Troglodyte paragons have the following ability scores instead of the standard troglodyte ability scores: Str 22, Dex 9, Con 16, Int 13, Wis 10, and Cha 15. They can use the following spell-like abilities: constant&mdash;<i>arcane sight</i> ; at will&mdash;<i>hypnotism</i>, <i>speak with animals</i> (dinosaurs and reptiles only); 3/day&mdash;<i>cause fear</i>, <i>charm monster</i> . Troglodyte paragons with at least 14 Hit Dice (including both racial HD and those from class levels) can also use <i>dominate monster</i> once per day.
