    "body": "<p>Squat, warty, and diminutive, these troglodytes average just under 4 feet tall and weigh 180 pounds. Kaergaths have dull reddish-brown scales and huge, square teeth, but lack the claws of the other troglodytes. Native to the upper reaches of the subterranean wilderness underneath trackless deserts and sun-scorched badlands, kaergaths are known for their ability to burrow through sand, their expertise with the javelin, and their preference for the flesh of humanoid children.</p><p>Kaergaths are troglodytes with the young simple template and the ability to burrow through sand and loose earth (but not stone) at a rate of 20 feet per round. They gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with javelins. Kaergaths have a bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage, but do not have claw attacks.</p>",
