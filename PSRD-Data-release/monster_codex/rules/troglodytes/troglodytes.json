    "body": "<p>Troglodytes are a race of feral, violent, reptilian cave dwellers. They are relatively common in the upper reaches of the great subterranean wilderness, and have a long history of raiding the settlements of other humanoids&mdash;particularly humans&mdash;for food and slaves.</p><p>A typical troglodyte stands about 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. Most are dull gray or gray-green, though other variations in coloration can appear depending on habitat. Troglodytes have short, stiff ridges running from the top of the head down to the base of the spine. They reach maturity at 10 years of age and have lifespans of about 50 to 60 years, though most troglodytes perish from violence much earlier than that. Troglodytes typically form primitive tribal societies, usually dominated by a powerful chieftain or a charismatic cleric or druid. Humans are a troglodyte's favored prey, and the very scent of a human is enough to drive troglodytes into a feeding frenzy. However, troglodytes are opportunistic predators that will hunt and devour other intelligent creatures if humans are unavailable. Troglodytes are also unapologetically cannibalistic, often eating the defeated members of rival tribes and the old and infirm members of their own tribe when other forms of prey are scarce.</p><p>Modern troglodytes are the degenerate descendants of an incredibly ancient race of reptilian humanoids known to scholars as the xulgaths, and indeed many troglodytes continue to use that name when they refer to themselves. Though the ancient xulgaths resembled modern troglodytes in form, they were more gifted, both intellectually and magically. When the world was still young, the xulgaths erected great stone cities of towering ziggurats, twisting canals and aqueducts, and many other advanced examples of stonework and architecture. Some of these still stand today in the deepest caverns of the underworld. Though the society the xulgaths built would be considered primitive by modern standards, it far outpaced the progress other races had made. Xulgath society was ruled by a religious caste of exceptionally powerful divine spellcasters who used their supernatural gifts to dominate their lesser kin and enslave the primitive humanoid races. The xulgaths worshiped ancient and inhuman gods, most notably the dreadful qlippoth lords who ruled the Abyss before the demon lords usurped their place.</p><p>However, the xulgaths were slow to progress and adapt, and lost their advantage. As hard as they fought against the rising civilizations of elves, dwarves, and other humanoids, they couldn't keep up with the technological progress the others had made. The xulgaths were finally cast down by one of the earliest human civilizations. All the xulgaths had created was lost, and many of them were enslaved. Now, not only have the troglodytes failed to keep up with other races, but they have in many ways regressed from what they once were.</p><p>A few large settlements of unusually civilized and intelligent troglodytes do exist in the deepest reaches of the world's subterranean wilds. Ruled over by despotic tyrants, these settlements consist of great stone ziggurats and other monolithic stone structures that modern troglodytes would be incapable of engineering and building on their own. Strangely, though these realms appear to be of xulgath origin, they were ruins before the enlightened troglodytes came to live there. This suggests that the troglodytes didn't live there continuously and develop their society, but rather abandoned the settlements as their civilizations collapsed into savagery, returning only when they became enlightened once again. Home to hundreds of organized troglodytes, these settlements are typically warlike in nature. Fortunately, the surface world remains safe from these aggressive raiders since these settlements are all located deep underground and remain isolated from the surface-dwelling races by miles of subterranean wilderness.</p><p>Troglodytes speak Draconic, though their vocabulary is limited because of their cultural isolation and stagnation. They are also adept at conveying information through gestures, guttural noises meant to convey their emotions, and culturally ubiquitous displays of dominance. Though troglodytes keep few written records, the creation of artwork has an important place within their culture as a leisure activity and religious practice. Troglodyte cave paintings and sculptures can be entirely abstract or loosely representational, and focus on expressing the creator's emotional state&mdash;joy and pride after a successful hunt, rage at a cunning enemy, or affection for family, for example&mdash;rather than conveying a complex narrative. Many troglodyte settlements keep lit torches so the vibrant colors of their art can be seen, since darkvision shows only black and white.</p><p>Religion is a strong influence among troglodytes, and their clerics and druids are almost always the highest regarded members of a tribe. Most tribes are led by charismatic clerics or druids. Chieftains who are incapable of wielding divine power find themselves serving as mere mouthpieces for the most powerful religious figures in the tribe. Troglodyte worship is a disorganized affair; veneration of the tribe's chosen demon lords mainly consisting of superstitious rituals, crude carvings and drawings on cave walls, and religious stories told and retold down countless troglodyte generations. Clerics among the troglodytes typically keep religious knowledge and power for themselves, encouraging their tribemates to worship devoutly but concentrating religious authority among an elite few. Troglodyte clerics typically choose their favorite offspring as their successors, prompting the children of holy people to engage in fierce (and sometimes bloody) competition to win the favor of their parents.</p><p>Full statistics for troglodytes can be found in their &lt;i&gt;Bestiary&lt;/i&gt; entry.</p>",
