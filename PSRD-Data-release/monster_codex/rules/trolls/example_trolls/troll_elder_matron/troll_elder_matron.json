The matron often lives or travels with females nearing adulthood who are struggling with their studies; those she rejects as unworthy rejoin their sisters and never speak of the strange things they experienced while apprenticed to the matron. Even a troll monarch listens to an elder matron's counsel, for she has outlived many monarchs and watched generations of trolls be born, grow, and die.</p>",
