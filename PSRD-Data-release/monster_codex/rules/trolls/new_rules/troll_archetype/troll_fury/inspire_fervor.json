    "body": "<p id=\"inspire-fervor\">At 1st level, once per day as a standard action, a troll fury can chant over another troll within 30 feet, bolstering it against fear and improving its combat abilities. This works like the inspire courage bard ability, but affects only one troll and lasts 1 minute. The troll fury uses her druid level as her bard level to determine the effects of this ability. This ability replaces wild empathy.</p>",
