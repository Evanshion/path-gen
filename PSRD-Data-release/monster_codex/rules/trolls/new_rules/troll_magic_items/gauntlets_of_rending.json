The wearer gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls with its claw attacks; the wearer adds this bonus damage once for each claw attack used in a rend. The crude construction and thick metal used in the gauntlets make it difficult for the wearer to perform fine manipulation. Consequently, the wearer takes a &ndash;4 penalty on all Dexterity-based checks involving her hands.</p>",
