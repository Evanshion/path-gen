    "body": "Instead of draining blood, a jiang-shi vampire drains \"chi,\" or life energy, from a victim's breath. When a jiang-shi makes a successful grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check, including additional damage), the jiang-shi can attempt to drain chi by drinking the victim's breath. The victim can resist this attack by succeeding at a DC 17 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim gains 1 negative level and is staggered for 1d4 rounds.",
