    "body": "The scroll attached to the brow of a jiang-shi grants immunity to any effects generated by spell-completion or spell-trigger magic items, such as scrolls and wands. Such magical effects treat the jiang-shi as if she had unbeatable spell resistance. A jiang-shi's prayer scroll can be removed with a successful steal combat maneuver, which immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to these effects. If a jiang-shi's prayer scroll is destroyed (a standard action), the vampire also loses her fast healing ability. A jiang-shi can create a replacement prayer scroll by using any strip of parchment and a writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work.",
