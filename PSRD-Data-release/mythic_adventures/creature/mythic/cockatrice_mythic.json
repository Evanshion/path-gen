Each time a creature is damaged by a mythic cockatrice's bite attack, it must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity damage as its flesh and bones stiffen and harden. If a creature's Dexterity score is reduced to 0 by a cockatrice's bite, that creature immediately turns completely to stone, as if petrified by a flesh to stone spell. Every day, a creature petrified by a cockatrice in this manner can attempt a new DC 12 Fortitude save; if it succeeds, the victim recovers from the petrification with a Dexterity score of 1 (and thereafter can be restored to full Dexterity by natural healing or magic as normal). If a petrified creature fails three of these Fortitude saves in a row, the petrified state becomes permanent. A creature restored to flesh via magic has any Dexterity damage caused by cockatrice bites removed, but not any existing Dexterity damage from other sources. A cockatrice is immune to the petrification ability of itself and of other cockatrices, but other petrification attacks affect them normally. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
