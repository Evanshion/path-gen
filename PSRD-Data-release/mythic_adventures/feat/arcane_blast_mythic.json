You can't move with an opponent you bull rush with this feat. You gain a bonus on your combat maneuver check for this attempt equal to half the spell level of the spell you sacrificed when using Arcane Blast, and you can substitute your Intelligence or Charisma modifier in place of your Strength modifier when determining your combat maneuver bonus.</p><p class=\"stat-block-1\">In addition, you can expend one use of mythic power to change the damage dice of your Arcane Blast to d8s instead of d6s.</p>",
