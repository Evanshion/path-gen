This is either a sacred bonus (if channeling positive energy) or a profane bonus (if channeling negative energy). If your attack misses the target, you can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to release the channeled energy, producing the normal effects of your channel energy class feature centered on the creature you were attempting to smite.</p>",
