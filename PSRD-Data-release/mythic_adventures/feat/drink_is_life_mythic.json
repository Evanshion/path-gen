Each time you consume an alcoholic beverage, you may gain one of the benefits of <i>polypurpose panacea </i>(<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic </i>232). You can have only one of these benefits active at a time. If you expend one use of mythic power while drinking an alcoholic beverage, you can heal 2 points of ability damage, negate a temporary penalty to one ability score, or remove one of the following conditions: confused, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, poisoned, shaken, sickened, or staggered.</p>",
