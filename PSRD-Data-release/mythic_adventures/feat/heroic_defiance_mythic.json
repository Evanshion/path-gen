When you do so, attempt a Will saving throw with a bonus equal to your tier against the original DC of the effect. If you succeed, the condition is negated. If you fail, the onset is delayed until the end of your next turn, after which it takes its normal effect. This feat has no effect on hit point damage or ability damage.</p><p class=\"stat-block-1\">This effect is separate from the use of non-mythic Heroic Defiance.</p>",
