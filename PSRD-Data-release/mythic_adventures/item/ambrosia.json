    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This divine food comes in many forms, from a light and airy honeyed cake to a deep, rich chocolate. A mythic creature that eats this food is restored and replenished. Eating this food takes 1 minute, and when the meal is done, the consumer regains all her uses of mythic power for the day. If a non-mythic creature consumes <i>ambrosia</i>, that creature is subject to <i>neutralize poison</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, and <i>remove disease</i>, each at caster level 10th. A mythic creature can choose to either gain this effect instead of regaining mythic power.</p>",
