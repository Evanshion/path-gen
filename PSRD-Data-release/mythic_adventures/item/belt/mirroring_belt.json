    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This broad belt is constructed of steel plates polished to a gleaming finish. The belt grants its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Three times per day, the wearer can use <i>mirror image</i> to bring forth illusory duplicates that persist for 6 minutes or until destroyed. These function as normal images from that spell, except any ranged attack (including ranged touch spells) that strikes and destroys an image rebounds onto the attacker, using the attacker's original result to determine whether the attack hits.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If the wearer expends one use of mythic power to activate the belt, the mirror images replenish when the wearer is hit. This functions as above, except each time an attack hits the wearer instead of an image, the belt creates a new image, up to the spell's limit of eight images. Unlike <i>mirror image</i>, the effect doesn't end when the images are gone. If there are no more images, the belt continues to create new images for the effect's full duration.</p>",
