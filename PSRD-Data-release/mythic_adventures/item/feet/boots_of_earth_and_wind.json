These boots function like <i>winged boots</i>, but also grant a +5 bonus to CMD against bull rush, overrun, and reposition combat maneuvers as long as the wearer is standing on solid ground. A mythic creature can expend one use of mythic power when commanding the boots to fly to gain the bonus to CMD for as long as she uses the boots to fly.</p>",
