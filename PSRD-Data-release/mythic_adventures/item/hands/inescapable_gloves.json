The wearer gains a +4 competence bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple. The wearer can expend one use of mythic power when a creature subject to <i>freedom of movement</i> or a similar effect attempts to escape the wearer's grapple with a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check. That creature must attempt the check as normal instead of automatically succeeding at it. If a creature attempts use a non-mythic teleportation effect to escape the grapple, the wearer can expend two uses of mythic power to negate that effect.</p>",
