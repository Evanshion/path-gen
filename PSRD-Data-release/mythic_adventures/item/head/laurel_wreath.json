If she succeeds at a saving throw against a harmful mind-affecting effect, the surge of confidence gives her a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls for 1 minute. If she fails such a saving throw, she is instead shaken for 1 minute, though this condition doesn't stack with other fear effects to make her frightened or panicked.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A mythic creature wearing the wreath gains 2 temporary hit points per tier at the start of each day. These temporary hit points are restored whenever the wearer rests 8 hours or otherwise gains the equivalent of doing so.</p>",
