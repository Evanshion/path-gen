    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This fist-sized statue of a curled-up cat is crafted from gleaming moonstone. When the statue is placed upon the chest of a helpless creature, it briefly animates and stretches like a real cat waking up from a fitful sleep, then curls up again. When this happens, the helpless creature is lulled into a deep sleep, and doesn't awaken until the cat is removed from its chest.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If the creature placing the cat expends three uses of mythic power while doing so, the helpless creature can't be awoken for a week, even if the cat is removed. If the user instead expends six uses of mythic power, the helpless creature can't be awoken for a month. If the user expends 10 uses, the helpless creature can't be awoken for a year. If the user expends 20 uses, the helpless creature can't be awoken for an entire century.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">While in this sleep, the helpless creature's heart rate and breathing slow to a barely perceptible rate. It doesn't need to eat or drink, though it must still breathe and it ages normally while in this magical sleep. A <i>wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>mythic break enchantment</i> can end this magical sleep.</p>",
