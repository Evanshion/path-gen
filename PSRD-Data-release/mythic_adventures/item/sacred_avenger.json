    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This <i>+3 cold iron longsword</i> becomes a <i>+5 holy defiant</i> <i>cold iron longsword</i> in the hands of a paladin or a lawful good mythic creature. If the creature wielding this weapon is a paladin with mythic tiers, she can also grant the weapon the <i>brilliant energy</i> special ability on command. Dismissing the <i>brilliant energy</i> ability is a free action.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">When wielded by a paladin or a lawful good mythic creature, this weapon provides spell resistance equal to 5 + the character's paladin class level (if any) + the character's mythic tier (if any) to the wielder and anyone within 10 feet of her. It also enables the wielder to use <i>mythic greater dispel magic</i> once per round as a standard action, with a caster level equal to either the wielder's paladin class level or double her mythic tier, whichever is higher. <i>Mythic greater dispel magic</i> functions as <i>greater dispel magic</i> including the benefits of the <i>mythic dispel magic</i> spell, but when the wielder dispels a spell, she heals 1d6 points of damage for every spell level of the dispelled spell instead of healing 1d4 points of damage.</p>",
