    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This rough-spun green cloak is trimmed in wolf fur and fastened with a silver clasp. With the cloak drawn over his shoulders and the hood pulled up, the wearer becomes one with his surroundings, gaining a +5 bonus on Stealth checks and on Survival skill checks made to follow tracks. The cloak also renders the wearer immune to the scent ability.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If the wearer expends one use of mythic power, the cloak turns him invisible for 1 hour, as <i>greater invisibility</i>. If the wearer makes an attack, the effects last for 1 minute after the attack, then end. A character made invisible by this cloak can't be detected with <i>detect magic</i> or other spells or effects that detect magical auras. The <i>greater invisibility</i> can't be penetrated, revealed, or dispelled by spells of 2nd level or lower (such as <i>see invisibility</i> or <i>glitterdust</i>), though <i>true seeing </i>and dust of <i>appearance</i> can reveal the wearer's presence.</p>",
