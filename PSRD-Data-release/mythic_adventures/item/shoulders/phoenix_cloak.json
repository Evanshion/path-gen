    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This cloak is made of tough leather, and is decorated with brilliant red and orange feathers. As a free action, the wearer can rub her hands together, setting them alight&mdash;thus granting her natural attacks and unarmed strikes the burn special ability (<i>Bestiary</i> 298; 1d6, Reflex DC 14). The wearer can use this ability for up to 10 rounds per day, which don't need to be consecutive.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If the wearer takes damage that would reduce her below 0 hit points, she can expend one use of mythic power to transform into a phoenix-like being. This doesn't require an action. When this happens, she is immediately affected as though targeted with a <i>breath of life</i> spell (CL 9th) and polymorphs into a bird-like creature made of flames (as <i>elemental body II</i>, CL 9; fire elemental only). While in this form, the wearer also gains a fly speed of 50 feet with good maneuverability, as well as a +4 bonus on Fly skill checks due to this maneuverability.</p>",
