They grant a +4 bonus on all Strength ability checks and Strength-based skill checks. As a swift action up to three times per day, the wearer can call upon the power of these bracers to gain a +4 sacred bonus to Strength for 1 round. The wearer can expend one use of mythic power to treat one Strength ability check or Strength-based skill check as if he rolled a natural 20.</p>",
