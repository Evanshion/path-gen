You immediately pass through the portal and arrive at the destination, but you can't take any other creatures with you.</p><p>When casting the spell, you can designate a number of creatures equal to your caster level. These creatures can see and use the portal, passing through it to arrive at the destination (this isn't an action). A creature that passes through the portal can't take any other actions until its next turn.</p>",
