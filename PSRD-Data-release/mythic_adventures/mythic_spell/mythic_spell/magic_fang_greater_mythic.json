You can add one of the following weapon special abilities to natural attacks or unarmed strikes affected by the spell: <i>flaming</i>, <i>frost</i>, <i>keen</i>, <i>merciful</i>, <i>shock</i>, or <i>thundering</i>. You must choose only one with each casting of the spell. For example, you can't add <i>flaming</i> to a tiger's bite and <i>keen</i> to its claws with the same casting. If the target has an Intelligence score less than 3, these abilities are always on (the target can't activate or deactivate the effect) and it might react with fear if its attacks make noise or create visible energy.</p>",
