    "body": "<p>The casting time changes to 1 standard action and the target changes to 1 living creature or corpse touched. The spell removes the blinded, dazzled, and deafened conditions. The target gains regeneration equal to your tier (overcome by acid and fire) for 1 round per caster level. If the target was killed by amputation or decapitation (such as from a <i>vorpal</i> weapon) within the past 1 round, the spell regenerates lost body parts and brings the creature back to life (as <i>breath of life</i>), treating it as if it had negative hp equal to its Constitution score.</p>",
