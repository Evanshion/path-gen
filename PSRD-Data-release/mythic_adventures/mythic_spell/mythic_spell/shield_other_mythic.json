Subtract your tier from any damage transmitted to you through the mystical connection before applying the damage (minimum 1 hp of damage). When you use your surge ability to modify a saving throw against an effect that also affects your linked ally, the ally also applies your surge bonus die result to the ally's saving throw. If the ally also uses its own surge ability, it takes either your result or its result, whichever is higher.</p>",
