    "body": "<p>When a mythic character completes a particularly difficult task, the GM might reward that character with a boon. A boon represents having earned the favor of the source of the character's power. Once acquired, a boon allows the character to draw upon mythic power one additional time that day. A mythic character might be rewarded with a boon several times in a single session, but no more than once per encounter.</p>",
