    "body": "<p>Mythic characters should be rewarded with experience points and treasure based on the higher overall CR of the encounters they face. In general, this means mythic characters will earn experience points and treasure at a faster rate than their normal counterparts. As a result, the GM is encouraged to use the medium or even slow experience point and treasure value progressions for such characters. Note that mythic characters will face fewer encounters to reach their next character level, but their XP and treasure totals should still fall relatively close to those of a non-mythic character of the same level.</p><p>The <i>Core Rulebook</i> doesn't include XP rewards for encounters above CR 25 or treasure rewards for encounters above APL 20, but mythic characters might regularly face such challenges and gain such rewards. The High CR Experience Point Awards table and High CR Treasure per Encounter table give you the XP and treasure rewards for encounters up to CR and APL 30.</p>",
