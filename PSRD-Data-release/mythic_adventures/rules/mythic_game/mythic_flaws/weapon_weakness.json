Weapons from the selected group gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls against you. If a weapon from the selected group scores a critical hit against you, the critical multiplier is increased by 1 (to a maximum of &times;4). If you have damage reduction, weapons from that group always bypass that reduction.</p>",
