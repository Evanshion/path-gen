    "body": "<p>A key part of the mythic narrative is that the characters don't start out as mythic heroes. Even if they gain their powers during the opening scenes of their first adventure, each character has an ordinary life before their ascension. This helps to ground them in the world and gives them a framework by which they can understand the magnitude of this change within them. That's not to say the seed of mythic power couldn't have been a part of them since birth, but such latent power should be hidden from them until the appropriate time.</p>",
