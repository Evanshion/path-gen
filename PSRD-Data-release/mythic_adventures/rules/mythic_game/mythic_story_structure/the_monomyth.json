    "body": "<p>The structure of a mythic game is drawn from the concept of the \"monomyth,\" outlined in Joseph Campbell's book, <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i>. This pattern is found throughout countless modern and ancient mythological tales, from the Bible to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. You won't have to search hard to find examples in books and films. Game Masters are encouraged to read up on the monomyth in more detail, as well as examine other stories and media that use this pervasive narrative structure.</p>",
