The divine powers of each realm perceive the others as threats and seek to do away with the rival \"mockeries\" of their own world through their ascended champions. The PCs are selected on behalf of their world's pantheon of gods while searching out their opponents, some of whom might be eerily similar to them. GMs can offer players the choice of vanquishing their opponents or of allying with them in a joint effort to stop this cosmic bout.</p>",
