Finding its world gone and all of its family and kin perished at the hands of heroes long since past, its mind collapses into madness. The creature vows revenge on all its foes' descendants, or perhaps even the entire world, and slaughters in blind rage. The heroes must find a way to stay the avenger's madness or put the tormented soul to rest.</p>",
