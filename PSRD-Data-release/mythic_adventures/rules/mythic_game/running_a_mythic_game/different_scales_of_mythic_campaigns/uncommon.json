    "body": "<p>Mythic creatures and characters are uncommon in this scale of game, but not wholly resigned to the whispers of legend. The PCs also get mythic power, but their advancement in tier is slow. The GM can control this by limiting the number of trials that are presented. Likewise, mythic foes are still not pervasive, but are found with some regularity&mdash;leading secret cabals, harassing quiet villages on the edge of civilization, and dwelling in the dark places of the world.</p>",
