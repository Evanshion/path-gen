    "body": "<p id=\"abundant-casting\">Whenever you cast a spell that specifically targets a limited number of targets (such as \"one creature/level\" or \"one or more creatures\"), add your tier to the number of targets the spell can affect. For example, a 5th-level wizard/1st-tier archmage can target up to six creatures when casting <i>haste</i> (five from caster level 5th and one from 1st tier). Alternatively, you can expend one use of mythic power when casting a spell that affects only one target (such as \"one creature\") to have the spell affect an additional target. If the spell requires you to succeed at a melee touch attack, you must hold the charge (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 185) in order to make a second touch attack.</p>",
