    "body": "<p id=\"flexible-counterspell\">Your mythic power enhances your ability to counter others' spells. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt to counter a spell. This ability otherwise works like readying an action to counter a spell, except instead of using the exact spell or <i>dispel magic</i>, you can instead expend a spell or spell slot of a level equal to or higher than the target spell.</p>",
