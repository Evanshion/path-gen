    "body": "<p id=\"greater-familiar-link\">You have bound yourself so deeply to your familiar that your life forces are intertwined. Anytime you or your familiar takes damage, you may split the damage evenly between you and your familiar as if using <i>shield other</i>. Using this ability doesn't require an action, but it works only if you're conscious and both you and your familiar are alive. You must have a familiar to select this ability.</p>",
