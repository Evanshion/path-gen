    "body": "<p id=\"arcane-potency\">Choose one of your arcane spellcasting classes. You gain four bonus 1st-level arcane spell slots for that class (like the bonus spells gained from a high ability score). This ability doesn't change your number of spells known. You can select this ability more than once. If you choose the same arcane spellcasting class a second time, you gain four bonus 2nd-level spell slots; if you choose it again, you gain 3rd-level slots for choosing it a third time, and so on. This ability can't grant you bonus spells for a spell level that you don't have the ability to cast.</p>",
