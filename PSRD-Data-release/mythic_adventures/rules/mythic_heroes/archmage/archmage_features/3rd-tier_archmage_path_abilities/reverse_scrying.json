    "body": "<p id=\"reverse-scrying\">When you notice a scrying sensor created by a scrying magical effect, you can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to use that sensor to observe its creator. If the initial scrying effect allows the target a saving throw, the sensor's creator can attempt a saving throw with a DC equal to 10 plus double your tier to realize you are attempting to observe it and block this attempt. If you act strangely once you notice the sensor, its creator might realize you're aware of it; at the GM's discretion, you may need to attempt a Bluff check against the creator's Sense Motive. If your reverse scrying goes unnoticed, you can expend an additional use of mythic power to control what the caster perceives, as if you had cast <i>false vision</i> with a duration of concentration and a caster level equal to double your tier.</p>",
