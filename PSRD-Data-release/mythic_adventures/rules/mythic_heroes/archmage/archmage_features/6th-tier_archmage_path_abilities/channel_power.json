    "body": "<p id=\"channel-power\">You gain the ability to channel raw arcane power into a spell. You can also expend one use of mythic power when casting an arcane spell to increase its damage by 50%. If the spell has a duration greater than 1 round, the duration doubles. Any saves required by the spell take a &ndash;4 penalty, although for mythic creatures, this penalty is reduced to &ndash;2. This spell ignores any spell resistance the targets have, although targets immune to the spell or to magic still retain that protection.</p>",
