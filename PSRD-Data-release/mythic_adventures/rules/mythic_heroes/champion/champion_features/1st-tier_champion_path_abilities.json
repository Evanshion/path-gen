Using this ability is a standard action that requires you to attempt a sunder combat maneuver check against your foe. If the check is successful, reduce the target's armor bonus, natural armor bonus, or shield bonus (your choice) by half your tier (minimum 1). If the creature has an enhancement bonus to the bonus you chose, reduce the normal bonus first, then apply any leftover reduction to the enhancement bonus. You can't reduce the bonus below 0. Armor and shields damaged in this way can be repaired as if they had the broken condition. Natural armor regains the lost bonus at the rate of 1 point per day. <i>Lesser restoration</i> restores 1d4 points of natural armor bonus, and <i>restoration</i> restores all of it.</p>",
