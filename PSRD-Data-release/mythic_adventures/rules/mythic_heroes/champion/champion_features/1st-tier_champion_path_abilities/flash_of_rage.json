    "body": "<p id=\"flash-of-rage\">Whenever you or an ally within 30 feet is struck by a critical hit, you can enter a rage as a free action on your next turn. This rage functions as the barbarian class feature, and lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier. You aren't fatigued after this rage. If you have the rage class feature, these rounds don't count toward your daily uses of that ability, you can use abilities that require patience and concentration while in this rage (although you are still restricted when using your rage class feature normally), and these rounds of rage don't count toward the total number of rounds of rage used when determining how long you are fatigued. Rounds of rage granted by this ability don't stack, but the duration is reset if another critical hit occurs.</p>",
