    "body": "<p id=\"shatter-spells\">You can destroy a magical effect (whether it's on a creature or an independent effect such as a <i>wall of fire</i>) by attacking it with an unarmed strike or natural weapon. You must succeed at a melee touch attack against the creature or effect and expend one use of mythic power. If this attack hits, the creature or effect is subject to targeted <i>greater dispel magic</i>, using double your tier as your caster level. If you dispel an effect, you suffer no harmful effects from touching it. If the effect is on a creature, the creature takes 1 point of damage per spell level of each effect dispelled.</p>",
