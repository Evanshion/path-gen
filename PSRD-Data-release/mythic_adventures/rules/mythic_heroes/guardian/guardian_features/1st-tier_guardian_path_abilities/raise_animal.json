{
    "body": "<p id=\"raise-animal\">By burying the corpse of a dead animal (at least its bones) and expending one use of mythic power, you raise it from the dead overnight. You can use this ability on an animal companion, familiar, or bonded mount even if it is not a creature of the animal type. At 1st tier, this functions like <i>raise dead</i>. At 3rd tier, this functions like <i>resurrection</i>. At 6th tier, this functions like <i>true resurrection</i>.</p>",
