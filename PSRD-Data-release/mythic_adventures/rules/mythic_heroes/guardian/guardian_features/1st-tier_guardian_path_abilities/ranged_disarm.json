{
    "body": "<p id=\"ranged-disarm\">You can use a ranged attack to disarm an opponent. Attempt a disarm combat maneuver check using your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier, and add your tier to the roll. Using this ability doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If your attack is successful, your target drops one item of your choice that it is carrying, even if the item is wielded with two hands. If your attack exceeds the CMD of the target by 10 or more, the target drops the items it is carrying in both hands (maximum two items if the target has more than two hands). Unlike with a melee disarm, failing the attack by 10 or more doesn't make you drop your weapon, and you can't automatically pick up the item dropped.</p>",
