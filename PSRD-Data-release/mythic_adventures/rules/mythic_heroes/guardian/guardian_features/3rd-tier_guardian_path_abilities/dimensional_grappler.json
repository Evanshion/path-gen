    "body": "<p id=\"dimensional-grappler\">When you have an opponent grappled or pinned and it attempts to use a teleportation effect, you can attempt a Will save against the effect, even if it would not normally allow a save. If you succeed, you learn the type of teleportation effect (such as <i>dimension door</i>) and the creature's intended destination, and then may prevent the effect (as if using a quickened <i>dimensional anchor</i>, using your character level as your caster level) or accompany the opponent as if you were part of its gear with negligible weight.</p>",
