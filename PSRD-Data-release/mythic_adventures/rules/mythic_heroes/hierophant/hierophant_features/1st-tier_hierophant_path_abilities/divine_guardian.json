    "body": "<p id=\"divine-guardian\">As a full-round action, you can expend one use of mythic power to summon one extraplanar creature as if using a <i>summon monster</i> or <i>summon nature's ally</i> spell, with the level of the summoning spell equal to half your tier. Your caster level for this ability is equal to your character level. You can have only one creature that has been summoned using this ability at a time; summoning another causes the previous one to disappear. If you expend two uses of mythic power, the level of the summoning spell is equal to your tier instead. For example, if you are a 10th-level druid, 5th-tier hierophant, you can use this ability to summon one creature from the <i>summon monster II</i> or <i>summon nature's ally II</i> list (or a lower-level list) for 10 rounds; if you expend two uses, you can instead summon one creature from the <i>summon monster V</i> or <i>summon nature's ally V</i> list (or a lower-level list).</p>",
