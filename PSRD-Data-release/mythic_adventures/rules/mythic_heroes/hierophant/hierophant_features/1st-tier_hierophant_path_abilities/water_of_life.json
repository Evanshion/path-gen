    "body": "<p id=\"water-of-life\">Any potions you consume have the maximum effect, as if they were created using the Maximize Spell feat. You can quickly create a temporary potion by casting a spell into a pint of water. The spell must be a valid choice for the Brew Potion feat and have a spell level no higher than your tier. The targeted liquid becomes a potion of that spell. If not consumed, the temporary potion reverts to normal water after 1 hour per tier.</p>",
