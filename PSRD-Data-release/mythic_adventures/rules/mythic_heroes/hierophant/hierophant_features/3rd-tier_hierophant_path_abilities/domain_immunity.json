    "body": "<p id=\"domain-immunity\">You don't take damage or suffer harmful effects from spells on your domain spell list, even ones you aren't of a high enough level to cast. If you're targeted by any of these spells, as an immediate action you can expend one use of mythic power to turn the spell back upon the original caster as if using <i>spell turning</i>. Beneficial effects of spells on your domain spell list affect you normally. If you're an oracle, this ability applies to your mystery's bonus spells. You must have the domain class feature or mystery class feature.</p>",
