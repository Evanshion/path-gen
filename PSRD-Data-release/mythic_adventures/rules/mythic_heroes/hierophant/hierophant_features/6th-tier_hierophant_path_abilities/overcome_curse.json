    "body": "<p id=\"overcome-curse\">You are immune to curse effects. For example, <i>bestow curse</i> has no effect on you, and you can handle, carry, or discard a cursed magic item without harm. If a cursed item has useful functions and a cursed effect (such as <i>armor of arrow attraction</i>) or drawback (such as a <i>mace of blood</i>), you are immune to the cursed effect and drawback, and can still use its other abilities. If a cursed item works normally for a period of time before its curse triggers (such as <i>gauntlets of fumbling</i>), the item stops working for you when the curse would normally trigger. If you're an oracle, you can ignore the negative effects of your oracle's curse.</p>",
