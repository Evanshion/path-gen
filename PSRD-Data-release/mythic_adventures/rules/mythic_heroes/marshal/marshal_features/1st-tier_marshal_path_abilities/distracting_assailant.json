    "body": "<p id=\"distracting-assailant\">You make a barrage of attacks and quick feints that are so distracting your opponent loses focus against all other assailants. Whenever you successfully strike a foe with a melee weapon or natural attack, you can expend one use of mythic power as a swift action. For 1 round, that opponent loses its Dexterity bonus to AC on all attacks against it other than yours. While this ability is in effect, any allies who flank that foe gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls against it, instead of the normal +2. While the opponent is affected by this ability, each time you hit it, the duration increases by 1 round. This effect automatically ends if your turn ends and the target is not within your melee reach.</p>",
