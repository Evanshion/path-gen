When a opponent makes a melee attack against one of your allies, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to move up to double your speed or take a 5-foot step. You must end this movement adjacent to the attacking opponent. When you end this movement, you can immediately use the aid another action to grant a bonus to your ally's AC (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 197). This bonus is applied before the opponent's triggering attack.<span class=\"hyperlink char-style-override-14\"> </span>These actions don't count against your actions this turn.</p>",
