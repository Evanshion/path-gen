    "body": "<p id=\"menacing-presence\">Something about you puts others on edge. You can attempt an Intimidate check to influence a creature's attitude as full-round action instead of it taking 1 minute. In combat, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize an opponent as a move action. If you expend one use of mythic power, you can attempt to use Intimidate to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet as a standard action, or as a move action if using the Dazzling Display feat.</p>",
