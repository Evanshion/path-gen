When in a small town or larger settlement, you can expend one use of mythic power to gather a crowd. Doing so takes 4d10 minutes. Add your tier to your Charisma bonus and then multiply the sum by 5 to determine how many creatures are in the crowd (as long as the settlement has a sufficient population to provide a crowd of that size, as determined by the GM). For example, a 4th-tier marshal with a +6 bonus to Charisma could gather as many as 50 creatures. The crowd remains for 1 hour, and you gain a +10 competence bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks to direct the crowd. You can expend another use of mythic power to extend the effect for another hour. This is a language-dependent effect.</p>",
