    "body": "<p id=\"inspiring-assault\">As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to inspire your allies to greatness in combat. Once per turn as a free action, each of your allies can either move up to its speed or make one melee or ranged attack at its full base attack bonus. These actions don't count against its actions for the turn. Once activated, this ability lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier, but immediately ends if you don't damage an opponent with an attack or spell on your turn. This ability doesn't stack with <i>haste</i> or similar effects. An ally must be within 30 feet of you at the start of its turn to benefit from this ability.</p>",
