You automatically succeed at all Acrobatics checks to walk along narrow ledges. Your Acrobatics checks never take a penalty because of obstructed, slippery, sloped, or unsteady surfaces, and you can move at full speed across such surfaces with no penalty. You also gain a +10 bonus to CMD against trip attacks.</p>",
