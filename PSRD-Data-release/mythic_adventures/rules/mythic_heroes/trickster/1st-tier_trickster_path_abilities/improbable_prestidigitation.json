    "body": "<p id=\"improbable-prestidigitation\">You can attempt a Sleight of Hand check to hide or retrieve objects in a personal extradimensional space, similar to a <i>glove of storing</i>. You can take 10 or 20 on this check, and the space can hold up to 1 cubic foot of material per tier. An item the size of a potion or dagger can be stored or retrieved with a successful DC 20 Sleight of Hand check; the DC increases to 25 for an item roughly the size of a one-handed weapon. Storing an item is a swift action, and retrieving it is a move action. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to retrieve any number of items from your extradimensional space.</p>",
