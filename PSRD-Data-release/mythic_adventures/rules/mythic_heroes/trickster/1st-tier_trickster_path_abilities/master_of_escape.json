    "body": "<p id=\"master-of-escape\">You can use the Escape Artist skill to break free from spells and magical effects that limit your movement or actions. While you're subject to a spell or effect that gives you the entangled, grappled, paralyzed, pinned, staggered, or stunned condition, once per round as a free action, you can attempt an Escape Artist check to end the condition. The DC for this check is equal to the save DC of the spell or effect that caused the condition. If you succeed, you end one such condition on yourself (your choice), though this doesn't make you immune to similar effects from the same source (such as moving through <i>black tentacles</i> or <i>web</i>). If the spell or effect doesn't allow a saving throw, you can't use this ability to overcome it.</p>",
