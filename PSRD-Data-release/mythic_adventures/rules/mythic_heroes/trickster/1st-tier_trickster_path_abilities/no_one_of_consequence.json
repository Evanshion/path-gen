    "body": "<p id=\"no-one-of-consequence\">Your mythic nature is a cloak that can shield you from the minds and memories of others. Creatures struggle to recognize you, recall your appearance, remember the nature of conversations they had with you, and recount the actions you took when you were in their presence. If a creature makes a deliberate attempt to recall details about time spent with you, it must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier) to recall anything beyond vague details. In addition, you're under a permanent <i>nondetection</i> effect with a caster level equal to your character level plus your tier. You can end this effect at any time, and can resume it as a swift action.</p>",
