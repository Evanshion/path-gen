    "body": "<p id=\"ranged-disable\">As a standard action, you can use a thrown weapon or reach weapon to attempt a Disable Device check to disable a device. If you're using a thrown weapon, the range of this ability is 30 feet; otherwise, it's your reach with the reach weapon. You take a &ndash;5 penalty on the check and can't take 10 on the check, even if you have an ability that would normally allow you to do so. If you expend one use of mythic power, you ignore the &ndash;5 penalty and can attempt the check in place of an attack (such as if making a full attack or attack of opportunity).</p>",
