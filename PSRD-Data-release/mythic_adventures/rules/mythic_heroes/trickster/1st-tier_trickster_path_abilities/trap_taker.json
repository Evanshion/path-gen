    "body": "<p id=\"trap-taker\">You can use the Use Magic Device skill instead of Disable Device to disable magical traps. If your Use Magic Device check overcomes the DC to disable the trap by 5 or more, you can instead leave the trap in place, but change it so that you and your allies can bypass it. You can also alter the trap so the original creator and any creatures he might have designated as safe instead set off the trap. If you expend one use of mythic power when altering a trap in this way, you can move the trap to any point within 100 feet that is in line of sight.</p>",
