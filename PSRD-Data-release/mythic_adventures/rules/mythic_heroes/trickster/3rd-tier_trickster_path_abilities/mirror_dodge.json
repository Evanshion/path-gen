    "body": "<p id=\"mirror-dodge\">When hit by a melee or ranged attack, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to replace yourself with an illusory duplicate and teleport to any open square within 30 feet of your current position. You take no damage from this attack, which instead destroys your illusory duplicate (similar to <i>mirror image</i>). Using this ability requires a line of effect to the teleportation target square.</p>",
