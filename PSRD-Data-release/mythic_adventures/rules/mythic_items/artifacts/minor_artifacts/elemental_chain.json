But when a mythic creature grasping them expends one use of mythic power as a swift action, they explode into a 10-foot-long spiked fighting chain formed from of the wielder's choice of acid, cold, fire, or electricity. The wielder can dismiss this effect as a free action. The chain is a <i>+6 spiked chain</i> that deals 4d6 points of damage of the chosen type instead of the normal damage typically done by a spiked chain. Once activated, the chain retains it shape for 1 hour or until the wielder dismisses the weapon, whichever comes first.</p>",
