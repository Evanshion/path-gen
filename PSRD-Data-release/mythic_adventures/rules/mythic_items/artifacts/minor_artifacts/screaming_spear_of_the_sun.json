    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This <i>+4 wounding throwing longspear</i> has a 2-foot-long iron spearhead covered with over 30 cruel flesh barbs. On a critical hit, the barbs lodge in the victim's flesh and can be removed only by tearing the blade free. Yanking the blade free is a full-round action that requires a successful Strength check with a DC equal to the attack roll that struck the critical hit, and deals 3d6 points of damage to the victim.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">In the hands of a mythic creature, the spear gains the <i>returning</i> special ability, and when thrown seemingly comes alive, screaming wickedly as it flies. When it hits a creature, it radiates <i>fear</i> (as the spell) in a 60-foot-radius burst surrounding the creature struck.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Each use of mythic power the wielder expends when throwing the spear increases the spear's throwing range by 100 feet.</p>",
