Anyone who wields the weapon gains low-light vision, resist nature's lure (as the druid class feature), and the ability to speak and understand Sylvan.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The wielder can expend one use of mythic power to imbue the blade for 1 minute with the ability to bypass the hardness of any solid object and cut through even the toughest material as if slicing through butter.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Once per week, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to enter the primal world of fey from the Material Plane or vice versa.</p>",
