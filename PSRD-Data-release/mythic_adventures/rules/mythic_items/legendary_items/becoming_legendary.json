Though all are powerful, some become even greater magical objects&mdash;minor and major artifacts.</p><p>Paralleling the trajectory of a mythic character, a legendary item begins as a normal magic item that ascends to something greater. Typically this ascension occurs when a character first takes the legendary item universal path ability, but this isn't always the case. Deities, the servants of deities, peculiar chance, magical experimentation, and destiny can serve as catalysts for legendary item ascension. Such items can be bestowed upon the worthy or found by the lucky.</p><p>Legendary items are always non-consumable magic items, and are typically magic weapons, magic armor, or magic items that take up an item slot (though there are a few legendary items that don't take up slots). Even vehicles and siege weapons can become legendary items.</p>",
