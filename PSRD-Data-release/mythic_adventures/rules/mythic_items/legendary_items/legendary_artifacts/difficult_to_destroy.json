    "body": "<p>An artifact can't be destroyed by normal means. Though a minor artifact has hit points and can be broken, it can't be destroyed by taking additional hit point damage. A major artifact is immune to hit point damage and can't gain the broken condition. Instead of being destroyed by taking hit point damage, both minor and major artifacts are instead destroyed when a creature successfully performs a very specific and often difficult task. The GM gets to determine what action is necessary to destroy the artifact, and should look to other artifacts' destruction entries for inspiration.</p>",
