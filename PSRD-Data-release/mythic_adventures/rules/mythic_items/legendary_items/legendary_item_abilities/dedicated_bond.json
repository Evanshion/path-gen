    "body": "<p>An item with this ability can't be used by anyone not bonded with it. Such creatures can't use the item's non-mythic special abilities, its legendary power, or its legendary surge. Furthermore, using a special ritual that takes 10 minutes to perform, the bonded creature can sequester the item in a solid object at least twice as large as the item (such as putting a sword in a stone or an oak tree). The item becomes impossible to remove by any creature not bonded to it unless by means of a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> cast by a mythic creature of higher tier than the bonded creature. If the bonded creature is at least 8th tier, she can instead perform this sequestering ritual and transfer the bond to another mythic creature she designates upon completing the ritual.</p><p>An item must be a minor or major artifact to have this ability. This is a persistent ability. <span class=\"hyperlink char-style-override-15\"></span></p>",
