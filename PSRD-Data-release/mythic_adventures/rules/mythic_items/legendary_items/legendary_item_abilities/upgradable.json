    "body": "<p>This ability grants the bonded creature the ability to more easily increase the non-mythic magical power of the legendary item. If the base magic item has a version with a higher bonus or greater version (such as a <i>+1 longsword</i>, a <i>+2 light steel shield</i>, a <i>cloak of protection +3</i>, an <i>amulet of might fists +4</i>, or a <i>minor ring of inner fortitude</i>), the bonded creature can improve it by performing a special ritual. She must spend a number of gold pieces equal to half the difference between the cost of the legendary item's current, non-mythic base item and the greater version she wishes to upgrade the item into. For example, she would pay 3,000 gp to upgrade a <i>+1 longsword</i> into a <i>+2 longsword</i>.</p><p>This ritual takes 8 hours. When it's completed, the bonded creature transmutes the item's base version into the desired version. When upgraded in this fashion, the legendary item retains all legendary item abilities it had before the transmutation.</p>",
