    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Three times per day, the wearer of a shield with this ability can cause a group of two dozen small, shiny metal plates to dislodge from the shield and orbit his immediate area. These metal plates protect the wearer and his allies from attacks, granting him and all allies within 10 feet a deflection bonus to AC. This bonus is equal to the shield's enhancement bonus. This ability lasts for 1 minute or until dismissed as a free action. A mythic wearer can expend one use of mythic power when using this ability to increase the deflection bonus granted by the shield by half his mythic tier (minimum 1). This ability can be applied only to steel shields.</p>",
