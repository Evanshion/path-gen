It grants its wearer a +5 inherent bonus to combat maneuver defense against bull rush, drag, grapple, overrun, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers and a +5 inherent bonus on saving throws against any effect that attempts to move the wearer with physical force or energy. Furthermore, if the wearer is a mythic creature and targeted by an effect that would teleport her, she can choose whether or not she wishes to be teleported.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">As a standard action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to create a 30-foot-radius aura that affects all enemy creatures within it as though they were subject to a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell. This aura lasts for a number of rounds equal to the wearer's mythic tier.</p>",
