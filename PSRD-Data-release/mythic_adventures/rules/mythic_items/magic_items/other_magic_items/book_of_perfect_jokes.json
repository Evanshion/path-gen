    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This small, weathered journal contains 10,000 jokes that change to be perfectly suited for particular audiences. The book grants its owner a +5 bonus on any Diplomacy check to influence the attitude of a creature. Additionally, up to three times per day the book can be used to cast <i>hideous laughter</i> (Will DC 13 negates).</p><p class=\"stat-block\">By expending one use of mythic power as a standard action, the book's reader can make a brutal verbal tirade mocking a creature. The target creature is enraged per the <i>rage</i> spell, and all other enemies within 30 feet of the target begin laughing uncontrollably, as <i>hideous laughter</i> (Will DC 14 negates either effect). The book contains only one perfect joke for any given creature, so attempting to use the book on a creature a second time yields no effect.</p>",
