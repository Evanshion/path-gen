Placing the incense is a move action, and igniting it is a standard action. If <i>incense of meditation</i> is burned instead of normal incense, the <i>sanctuary</i> effect is heightened to 7th level.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">While lighting the censer, the bearer can expend one use of mythic power to grant the benefits of the censer's <i>sanctuary</i> to all allies within a 20-foot-radius emanation of the censer for 10 minutes. Allies who attack break the <i>sanctuary</i> effect only for themselves. The incense extinguishes 1 round after the bearer ceases to use. If <i>incense of meditation</i> is extinguished before 8 hours of burning, the remainder becomes normal incense.</p>",
