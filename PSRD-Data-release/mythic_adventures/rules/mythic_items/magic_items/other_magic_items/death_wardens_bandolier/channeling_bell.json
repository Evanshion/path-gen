When it's rung as part of the action to channel positive energy to harm undead, it can take the place of the holy symbol needed for channeling. When it's used in such a manner, undead creatures within the area take an additional 2 points of damage per each die of the channelled energy. The undead take this extra damage even if they succeed at their Will saving throws.</p>",
