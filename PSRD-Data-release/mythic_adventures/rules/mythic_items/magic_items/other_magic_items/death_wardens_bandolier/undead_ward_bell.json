When it is rung as a standard action, it creates a 30-foot-burst aura that keeps out undead creatures. An undead creature can't enter the aura unless it succeeds at a DC 16 Will save. Undead within the aura take a &ndash;2 penalty on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, skill checks, and ability checks. The aura lasts for 5 rounds, but can be extended to 1 minute by expending one use of mythic power.</p>",
