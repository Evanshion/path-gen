If a sighted creature holds this orb and holds his eyes shut for 1 minute, he gains the blinded condition until he opens his eyes (as a free action), but can see through the orb as if he were a blind creature.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">By expending one use of mythic power, a creature using the <i>eye orb</i> can see as though using <i>true seeing</i>, and loses light sensitivity. These effects last for 1 minute or until he stops using the orb to see, whichever comes first.</p>",
