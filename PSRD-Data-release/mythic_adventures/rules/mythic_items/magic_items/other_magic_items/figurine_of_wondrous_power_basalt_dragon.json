    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This fist-sized, carved dragon is sculpted from volcanic rock. It becomes either a pseudodragon or a flame drake (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</i> 106), depending on the command word used. The transformation can take place twice per day, with a maximum duration of 2 continuous hours. The pseudodragon can use its telepathy to communicate with its owner over any distance, but not across planes.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">By expending one use of mythic power, the user of the figurine can instead transform the figurine into a young red dragon. If the user is at least 5th tier, she can instead expend two uses of mythic power to transform the figurine into an adult red dragon. If the user is at least 9th tier, she can instead expend four uses of mythic power to transform the figurine into an ancient red dragon. Transforming the figurine into a true dragon renders the figurine powerless for 1 week after the transformation ends.</p>",
