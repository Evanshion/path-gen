Its wearer stares out through the serpent's eyes, and sees all things cast in a yellow tint. When worn, it grants the following spell-like abilities to the wearer:</p><ul><li><i>Hypnotism</i> (3/day)</li><li><i>Summon nature's ally III</i> (constrictor snake only, 3/day)</li><li><i>Beast shape III</i> (snake form only, 1/day)</li><li><i>Poison</i> (1/day)</li></ul><p class=\"stat-block\">A mythic creature can expend one use of mythic power when using the <i>beast shape III</i> spell-like ability to instead cast it as <i>mythic beast shape III</i>. Alternatively, he can expend two uses of mythic power to instead cast the augmented version of <i>mythic beast shape III</i>.</p>",
