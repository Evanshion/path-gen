Consuming <i>nectar of the gods</i> is a standard action that restores 1d4+1 uses of mythic power to a mythic creature (up to the creature's maximum). If a non-mythic creature consumes this drink, it works like the <i>heroism</i> spell, lasting for 1 day. A jar contains only a single draft of this potent beverage.</p>",
