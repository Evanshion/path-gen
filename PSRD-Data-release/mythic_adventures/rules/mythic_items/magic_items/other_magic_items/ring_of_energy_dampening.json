It provides resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, and fire. The wearer can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action when taking damage of one of these types to upgrade the resistance to immunity for that attack or effect only. Also, once per day when the wearer takes damage of one of these types, the wearer can grant resistance 5 to the energy type damaging him to all allies within 20 feet. This resistance lasts for 1 minute.</p>",
