    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This jade ring is carved in the shape of an ouroboros. Three times per day, the wearer can use it to empower a spell she casts. This grants her a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance, and increases the save DC of the spell (if any) by 2.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">While enhancing a spell this way, the caster can expend one use of mythic power plus an additional use per two spell levels (minimum two uses), to instead cast the mythic version of her spell (though not an augmented version of the mythic spell) as if she knew the mythic version of that spell. This has no effect if the spell doesn't have a mythic version. The save DC increase for being a potent mythic spell stacks with the save DC increase granted by using the ring's power.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">For example, if the wearer enhances <i>fireball</i> with this ring, she can expend two uses of mythic power to cast <i>mythic fireball</i> instead (one use plus one use for a 3rd-level spell).</p>",
