While a creature wears <i>stonefist gloves</i>, his unarmed strike damage is treated as if he were one size category larger, and bypasses hardness of 8 or lower. When a mythic creature uses these gloves to make a sunder combat maneuver, he adds half his tier as a bonus on the combat maneuver check.</p>",
