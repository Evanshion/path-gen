As an immediate action, the wearer can negate the effects of a successful combat maneuver made to bull rush, overrun, or trip her. As a swift action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to gain immunity to ability damage, ability drain, critical hits, and sneak attacks. This effect lasts for 1 round per mythic tier the wearer possesses.</p>",
