    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This golden <i>+1 endless ammunition distance composite longbow</i> (+6 Str) produces a golden arrow whenever it's drawn. By expending one use of mythic power, the bow's wielder can make a single attack and compare the result against every enemy within 60 feet of her. The wielder rolls damage only once, and applies it to all foes hit by the attack. If the attack is a critical threat, the wielder chooses only one enemy hit and attempts to confirm the critical against that enemy.</p>",
