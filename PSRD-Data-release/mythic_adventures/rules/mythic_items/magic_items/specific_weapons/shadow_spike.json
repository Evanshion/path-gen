    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This <i>+2/+2 cruel quarterstaff</i> is made of polished ebony, and features a blackened metal spike on its bottom end. As a standard action, the wielder can drive the spike into the ground on either the Material Plane or the Shadow Plane, creating a rift merging those two planes. This rift is 30 feet in diameter, lasts for 1 minute, and can be created once per day. If the creature that drives the <i>shadow spike</i> into the ground expends one use of mythic power when doing so, the effect lasts until the <i>shadow spike</i> is pulled out of the ground (which takes a standard action).</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The rift's area acts as the <i>deeper darkness</i> spell. Spells with the darkness or shadow descriptors cast within the rift have +1 caster level, and are affected as if cast with the Extend Spell feat. As a standard action, any mythic creature within the area can expend three uses of mythic power to <i>plane shift</i> to the Shadow Plane (if on the Material Plane) or to the Material Plane (if on the Shadow Plane). If a mythic creature <i>plane shifts</i> while holding the <i>shadow spike</i>, the weapon teleports with that creature, ending the effect.</p>",
