    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Only one end of this iron-shod <i>+3 quarterstaff</i> has an enhancement bonus. The enhanced end acts as a <i>bane</i> weapon against any creature with the ability to cast spells or use spell-like abilities. As a standard action, the wielder can strike the unenhanced end against the ground while expending one use of mythic power to produce an <i>antimagic field</i> centered on the staff. This effect has a duration of 2 hours. Anyone striking the staff against the ground a second time dismisses the effect. The <i>antimagic field</i> remains in effect if the staff is dropped or disarmed. The staff retains its enhancement bonus and extra damage against spellcasters inside any <i>antimagic field</i>.</p>",
