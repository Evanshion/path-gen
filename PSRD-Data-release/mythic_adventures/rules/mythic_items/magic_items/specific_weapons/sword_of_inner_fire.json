    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This <i>+1 flaming burst brilliant energy longsword</i> has a burnished copper hilt and burns with blue and white flame. In the hands of a mythic wielder, the sword's fire damage bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity. As a swift action, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to enable the <i>sword of inner fire</i> to damage nonliving creatures (such as constructs and undead) for 1 round, though the sword still can't damage inanimate objects.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A wielder of at least 3rd tier can absorb the <i>sword of inner fire</i> into her body as a swift action, and call it back to hand with another swift action. While the sword is stored in this way, her eyes burn with orange flame and she gains a +5 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws.</p>",
