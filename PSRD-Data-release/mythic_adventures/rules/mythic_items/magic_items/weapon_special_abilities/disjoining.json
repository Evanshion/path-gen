When the wielder confirms a critical hit against a mythic creature with a <i>disjoining</i> weapon, the target loses the ability to expend its mythic power for 1d4 rounds. A mythic creature wielding a <i>disjoining</i> weapon loses the ability to expend uses of mythic power for as long as he wields the weapon. Only melee weapons can have this ability.</p>",
