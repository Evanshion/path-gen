    "body": "<p>The Monster Statistics by CR is an expansion of the table of the same name listed here, listing approximate statistics for monsters up to CR 30 (the information for CR 1&ndash;20 is identical to that presented in the <i>Bestiary</i>). These values are rough guidelines. You'll notice that many of the existing monsters in this section don't follow these guidelines exactly. Most monsters excel in one of these areas (usually in the amount of damage dealt), but lag in one or two other areas to balance them out. For example, a monster might have higher damage than what's listed in the table, but have a lower AC and hit points. The entries on the table are as follows.</p>",
