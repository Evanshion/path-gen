Every time the dragon is damaged by a piercing or slashing weapon, the attacking creature takes energy damage according to the table below (or double damage if the attack is a critical hit). Using a reach weapon does not endanger the attacker in this way. If the dragon has the swallow whole ability, it adds this damage to its swallow whole damage.<i>Format</i>: dragon blood (2d6 fire); <i>Location</i>: Defensive Abilities.</p>",
