Any creature in, entering, or passing through the breath weapon's area during this duration takes damage according to the creature's size. This ability has no effect on breath weapons that do not deal energy damage.<i>Format</i>: lingering breath (2d6 fire, 5 rounds); <i>Location</i>: Special Attacks.</p>",
