    "body": "<p id=\"second-save\">Whenever the creature fails a saving throw against an effect with a duration greater than 1 round, it can keep trying to shake off the effect. At the start of its turn, if it's still affected, it can attempt the save one more time as a free action. If this save succeeds, the effect affects the creature as if it had succeeded at its initial saving throw. If the effect already allows another saving throw on a later turn to break the effect (such as for <i>hold monster</i>), this ability is in addition to the extra saving throw from the effect.<i>Format</i>: second save; <i>Location</i>: after saving throws.</p>",
