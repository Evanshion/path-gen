    "body": "<p>Several mythic monsters have the Mythic Improved Initiative feat, which allows the creature to expend one use of mythic power to treat its initiative roll as a 20. Because you rarely check the Feats entry for a monster when rolling initiative, it would be easy to forget that ability when using the monster. As a reminder of this ability, a monster with that feat has a superscript \"M\" after its initiative modifier. The listed initiative modifier already includes the additional bonus from the Mythic Improved Initiative feat.</p>",
