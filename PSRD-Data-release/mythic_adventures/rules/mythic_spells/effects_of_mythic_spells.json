    "body": "<p>Unless otherwise specified, a mythic spell works just like the non-mythic version of the spell. For example, zombies created by both <i>animate dead</i> and <i>mythic animate dead</i> count toward the spell's HD limit of how many undead you can control at one time, and a chaotic creature is immune to <i>mythic chaos hammer</i> in the same way it's immune to <i>chaos hammer</i>.</p><p>Unless a mythic spell's description says it improves, replaces, or upgrades an effect of the non-mythic spell, or says that it creates an effect instead of the non-mythic spell's effect, it retains all the effects of the non-mythic spell in addition to the effects of the mythic version. For example, the <i>mythic blasphemy</i> spell has penalties for creatures that fail their saves; because the description doesn't indicate that these penalties replace those of non-mythic <i>blasphemy</i>, the penalties are in addition to the non-mythic spell's effects.</p>",
