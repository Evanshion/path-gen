Expend one additional use of mythic power; any check attempted in order to dispel the spell then takes a &ndash;4 penalty, and the spell can't be countered unless the opposing caster also expends a use of mythic power to overcome your spell's resilience (in which case the normal rules for counterspelling apply).</p><p>You may combine the potent and resilient forms of a spell; to do so, you must expend a total of two additional uses of mythic power. You can cast potent and resilient forms of augmented mythic spells in the same manner.</p>",
