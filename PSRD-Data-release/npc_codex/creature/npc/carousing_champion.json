He wants to see the world and enjoy life, and doesn't particularly care whether people are good or selfish as long they don't try to hurt him or anyone he cares about&mdash;to him, his god's creed of freedom above all means accepting that some people were born mean-spirited, and are entitled to their pettiness and jealousy as long as they don't go out of their way to oppress others. For his own part, he'd rather help someone than ignore a request for aid, and has been known to expound at length upon the simple joys of helping others. He avoids killing unless absolutely necessary, even among those more \"monstrous\" humanoid races, but hates undead with a passion and goes out of his way to destroy such abominations.</p>",
