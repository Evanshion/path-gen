Her grace and feisty nature caught the attention of a traveling swordmaster and assassin, who took in the halfling as a student and raised her as a daughter. He cultivated her kill-or-be-killed nature, and trained her to be fearless and utterly ruthless in both battle and life. Her former master is long dead, but she has taken his lessons to heart, becoming a bold and competent killer. These days she's something of a loner, but still keeps an eye out for promising young halflings similar to herself as a child, so that she might pass on her advice and training. Though much of her knowledge is loudly proclaimed to be a \"trade secret,\" she has often been known to boast of its central maxim: \"Hit first, hit hard, and don't stop till you're painted red.\"</p>",
