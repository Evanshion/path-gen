Some assume that since Mandar lives in the wild she has a grudge against civilization, like many druids do. This isn't the case; she simply prefers solitude. In fact, she loves some creature comforts, and might trade spellcasting services or information to nearby villages in exchange for food, clothing, or sweets for both herself and her familiar, Eink.
