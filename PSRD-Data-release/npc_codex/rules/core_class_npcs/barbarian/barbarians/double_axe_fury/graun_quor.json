The one constant was the thirst for blood sports, and any youth with a hard edge and more greed and ambition than fear could make a name and a fortune so long as he survived. Graun mastered many weapons throughout his career, but loves best the orc double axe he took as a prize in an early championship bout. Having long since bought his freedom, Graun wanders the borderlands selling his skills to the highest bidder. A few orc tribes have offered Graun leadership roles, but he has little patience for such things and cares nothing for the welfare of his allies.</p>",
