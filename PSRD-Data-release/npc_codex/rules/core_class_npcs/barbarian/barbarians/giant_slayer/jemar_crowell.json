Often clad head to toe in stout dwarven steel armor, Jemar sometimes doffs his helmet to better taunt enemies as he brings them low. He keeps his scalp shaved save for two narrow crests of hair. His cape is woven from shaggy skeins of loosely-spun giant hair clipped from his vanquished foes, and when the weather is cold he wears scarves and mittens knit from the same material.</p>",
