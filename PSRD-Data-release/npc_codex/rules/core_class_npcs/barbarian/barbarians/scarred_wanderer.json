While he learned much, killing could not restore his pride or his faith in his people, nor slake the rage in his heart. Since taking his leave from his companions, he has roamed the world in search of purpose. He fights now for the fun of it, and his temper has gradually cooled to dark embers. Still, he might join any nearby fray on any side. Should anyone land a blow he notices, he might begin to fight in earnest.</p>",
