She longs to become her favored servant and lover, and bestows her strange affections on corpses and undead that remind her of the dark goddess. Relyk always has a bit of a cold or some other minor sickness, though these never debilitate her or affect her abilities in any way; her symptoms might merely be affectations to ward off the unwary or show her devotion. She helps those who want to become undead do so, and is willing to assist other members of her church. However, she watches for anyone who might pass her in prominence within the church. Rivals for her god's affection or attention find that Relyk quickly becomes a devious, heartless enemy.</p>",
