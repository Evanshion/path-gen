    "body": "<p>NPC allies may have brief or lengthy roles in the campaign story. The mayor of the campaign's starting town might be a retired adventuring blacksmith (fighter 6) and recurring mentor character in the PCs' lives, or a noble crusader (cleric 5) could join the PCs for just one dungeon encounter. In a game where danger is only a die roll away, it's useful to have stat blocks for long-term and one-shot NPCs in a campaign&mdash;after all, if goblins overrun the town, the mayor's going to come out of retirement and help the PCs save the day. You can use all of these NPCs as is for this purpose, and they're good as cohorts as well.</p><p>Remember that you can always change an NPC's goals, personality, alignment, abilities, or gear to suit your campaign, and doing so is faster than creating a new NPC from scratch. It doesn't take much to change the stat block for an evil mother of beasts (cleric 10) into a benign animal- or elemental-themed cleric who'll help the PCs.</p>",
