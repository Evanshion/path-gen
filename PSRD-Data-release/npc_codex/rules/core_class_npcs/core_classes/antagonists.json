Each includes battle tactics specific to that character, preparations he or she makes before combat (if any), and gear appropriate to the character's level.</p><p>For most stat blocks (where space permits), there's additional information about an example character using those statistics. This is useful if you have to create an NPC on the spot and need a few words of background or goals to make that character feel more lifelike to your players&mdash;enough to turn a generic \"street magician\" into \"Berwick Thimblethane the enchanter-thief.\"</p>",
