You can use these clerics as worshipers of a similar deity or as clerics of divine concepts (godless clerics). You may instead change the cleric's listed domains, energy channeling, and prepared spells to suit your campaign; for example, you could change the alignment of the noble crusader (cleric 5) to lawful evil, her deity to an evil war deity, and her channel energy from positive to negative to create an evil priest-general.</p>",
