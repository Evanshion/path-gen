    "body": "<p>Remember that you always have the option to alter or add to these characters to make them even more useful to your campaign. It's easy to replace some of a character's feats, spells, and magic items from another source. In many cases, swapping class abilities for those of an archetype is fairly easy, as is altering a character's race.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the alteration, you might not need to adjust the stat block at all. For example, if the stat block is for a human character and you need a half-elf, each of those races has a bonus to one ability score of your choice, so you don't have to alter the character's ability scores. Unless you let your players see the stat block, they probably won't notice that the \"half-elf\" has a different feat instead of Skill Focus and more skill points than she should. If you use a human as a dwarf or a half-orc as a gnome, you usually can hand-wave the minor differences between the races and just use the stat block as presented.</p><p>The remainder of this section explains specific choices for each of the classes in this chapter.</p>",
