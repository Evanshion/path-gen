If the paladin's divine bond is with a weapon and you want to change it to be with a mount, consider spending some of the character's wealth on barding for the mount. If the divine bond is with a mount and you change it to be with a weapon, allocate any wealth for barding or other mount-related items to abilities on the paladin's weapon.</p>",
