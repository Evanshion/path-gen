    "body": "<p>A sorcerer's bloodline has a significant impact on the character's stat block, affecting spells known, a class skill, feats, and providing one or more bloodline arcana and bloodline powers. Changing a sorcerer's bloodline is not a simple matter unless you're just altering the type of dragon or elemental for the draconic and elemental bloodlines. Fortunately, by using colorful descriptions for the special abilities, your players probably won't notice the difference, so you can use these stat blocks for multiple purposes without rebuilding them.</p>",
