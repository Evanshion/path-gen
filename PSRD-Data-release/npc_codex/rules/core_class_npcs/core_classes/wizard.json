    "body": "<p>A wizard's school specialization affects the character's special abilities and spells prepared, and could have an impact on which feats are useful. You can easily change a wizard's focus as long as you don't change the oppositional schools. Some of the wizards in this chapter have familiars; you can replace the familiar with an arcane bonded item. This book does not include stat blocks for familiars because a familiar's abilities are very dependent on the wizard's statistics. The wizard's spellbook is included in his gear; assume the spellbook holds all the spells the wizard has prepared, plus spells from any scrolls the wizard has that he is high enough level to cast. Most level-appropriate scrolls carried are priced as if the wizard had scribed them.</p>",
