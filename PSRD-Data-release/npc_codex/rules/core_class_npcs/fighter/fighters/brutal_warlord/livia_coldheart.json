As an adult, she met her first orcs only to find they too saw her as sullied by her half-breed heritage. But there was a difference: When she kicked in humans' teeth, they called her a monster. When she bashed in orcs' skulls, the rest cheered her on.</p>",

She dreams that, in time, she will rule an empire of orcs and half-orcs.</p>",
