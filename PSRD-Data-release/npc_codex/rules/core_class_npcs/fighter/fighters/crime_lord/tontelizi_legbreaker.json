Soon, the crime family found that Tontelizi excelled at any task involving extortion, intimidation, or violence. When the patriarch's health failed&mdash;assisted by Tontelizi's poison&mdash;the gnome eliminated two likely successors and cowed the rest with threats and blackmail. He was chosen to take over the family with nearly unanimous support.</p>",
