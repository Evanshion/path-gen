When her mount perished in battle against a flock of perytons, Jalynel was devastated. Once she recovered from her own wounds, she deserted her unit and indentured herself to a powerful wizard. In exchange, he crafted for her a bronze figurine in the very image of her beloved griffon. Twice per week, she can place it on the ground and bring it life. Jalynel believes her companion's soul dwells within the figurine's cold bronze. She rests easy knowing a lethal wound now only turns her mount back to bronze, to be brought to life again another day.</p>",
