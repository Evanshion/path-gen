            "body": "<p>No dashing swashbuckler, Dalithan might best be described as a dastard in search of a crime. He leads his fleet on pirate raids by land and sea; hires his ships out for mercenary contracts; and dabbles in assassination, extortion, ransom, and smuggling as well. The warrants that authorities and victims try to put out for his death go unsigned thanks to a few well-placed bribes. Though he's widely regarded as a cold-hearted villain, his crewmates know the captain has a peculiar fondness for seals, often ordering meat&mdash;such as prisoners&mdash;chopped up and thrown overboard for them.</p>",
