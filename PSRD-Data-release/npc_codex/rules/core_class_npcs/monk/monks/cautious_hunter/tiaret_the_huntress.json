Tiaret was the only survivor, and her firststint as a bounty hunter involved hunting down each of the attackers and bringing them to justice. Since then, Tiaret has continued to use her talents to capture lawbreakers. Though she prefers jobs where the bounty is wanted dead or alive, if she thinks an opponent might have value, she attacks with nonlethal force and renders the foe unconscious.</p>",
