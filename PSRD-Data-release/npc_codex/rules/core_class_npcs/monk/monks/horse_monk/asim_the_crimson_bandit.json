His riches went to the temple to fund good works, and he gave his expensive clothes to the poor. Yet when territorial changes found the monastery's lands full of invaders, he found himself leading the resistance. Often this war requires robbing the supply trains of his enemies, and what Asim steals he splits between the poor and the war effort.</p>",
