She told the monks she had accidently killed a man with her horse, and wondered why it made her feel complete, at one with all being. The monks ushered her in, and though she was older than the other pupils, they trained her in the discipline of holy killing. Since that day, she has risen in the ranks, and is now one the monastery's prized slayers. Few expect the pretty but forgettable girl with the youthful gait to be a seasoned and a brutal killer.</p>",
