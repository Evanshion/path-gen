He was born the son of a minor dwarven thane, but chose to betray his family in exchange for the hand of the daughter of his father's rival. His betrayal was for naught, however, as he was double-crossed by his family's enemies and cast out from his childhood home. Now he hires himself out to this group or that, always searching for a way to erase his shame and win his way back into the warm embrace of his homeland, though he knows that this feat will prove to be nearly impossible&mdash;for dwarves do not easily forgive treachery.</p>",
