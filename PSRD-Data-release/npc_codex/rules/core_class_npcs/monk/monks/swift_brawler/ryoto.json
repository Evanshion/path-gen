He sat down before the gates of a monastery high up in the hills, and did not move for over a week, meditating without food or water. When he finally spoke, he looked up at the monks of the order and merely said, \"I am now you.\" The monks, sensing the fundamental truth in this cryptic statement, silently opened their doors and accepted him as one of their own.</p>",
