Her interest in this goal is neither cheerful nor curious; she has simply seen far too many villages destroyed and lives ruined by giant attacks. She sees it as her sworn duty to hunt and kill these evil beings so they cannot murder or enslave anyone else. So single-minded is her quest against giants that other gnomes have joked she must have dwarven blood in her ancestry. Since she respects dwarven tenacity and toughness, she takes this as a compliment.</p>",
