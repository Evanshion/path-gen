He spends so much time training with his steed that he often has a hard time interacting with people. Unlike his mount, people don't automatically react to his commands (especially since many of these are nonverbal cues),and he often sees their confusion as opposition. Commoners easily frustrate him, which makes him react with sarcasm. He values those people who see his wisdom, however, and is willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to keep them safe.</p>",
