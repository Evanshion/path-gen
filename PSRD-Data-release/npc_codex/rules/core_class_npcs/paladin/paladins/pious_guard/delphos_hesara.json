Despite his low tolerance for the city's corruption, Delphos would rather frighten, disarm, or subdue foes than kill them. He knows one dead body can create a war between powerful or desperate families, and peace is better served by the judicious use of force. The soldiers under his command either love him or hate him. Delphos tries to be harsh but fair, and believes that strict discipline and an organized system of punishments create better guardians. Such punishments take the form of extra duties or unpleasant posts. All punishments for his guards remain within his order&mdash;public shaming leads to disrespect and undermines their authority.</p>",
