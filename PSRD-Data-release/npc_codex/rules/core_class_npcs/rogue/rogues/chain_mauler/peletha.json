Soon she moved on to larger, bloodier animals, and started beating the children in her neighborhood at random. Taken in by a cult of the god of pain, she spent her teenage years as the \"pet\" of the high priest, learning to understand new heights of pain and how to inflict it upon others. Though she appreciates the delicacies of torture, she prefers more direct methods&mdash;namely, beating her victims with her magical spiked chain.</p>",
