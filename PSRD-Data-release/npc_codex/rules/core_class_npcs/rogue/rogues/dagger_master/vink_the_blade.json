Having experienced a fair share of mockery because of to his size, Vink's definition of threatening a halfling is very broad, including slight insults, roughhousing by larger races, and legal actions that limit halfling rights. Though he normally uses his blades against tyrants and rampaging monsters, he's been known to obliterate entire caravans of slavers, murder government officials who demean halflings or treat them as second-class citizens, and assassinate bards or actors who perform plays that treat halflings as subjects of ridicule.</p>",
