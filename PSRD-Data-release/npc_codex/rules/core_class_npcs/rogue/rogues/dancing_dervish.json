Afterward, he meditates to focus his memory on the joy of the prayer, sometimes unconsciously speaking some truth he learned from this connection. Though he often springs into battle if a cause seems justified and in keeping with his god's will, the truth is that the fighting is more important to him than the reason for it.</p>",
