            "body": "<p>Lesath is a troubled man who acutely feels the pain of separation from the divine, and only when he has a sword in hand do his dark thoughts stop. For him, the dance of the sword is a means of finding peace and spiritual tranquility. He dances several times per day (whether or not he is in combat) as a silent prayer ritual. Afterward, he meditates to focus his memory on the joy of the prayer, sometimes unconsciously speaking some truth he learned from this connection. Though he often springs into battle if a cause seems justified and in keeping with his god's will, the truth is that the fighting is more important to him than the reason for it.</p>",
