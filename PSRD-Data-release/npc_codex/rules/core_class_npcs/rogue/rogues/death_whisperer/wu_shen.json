She speaks of death as \"her lover\" and never as \"death\" or any proper name, and listeners may mistakenly believe she is referring to a mortal person. She relishes every killing, seeing them as love notes of a sort. Death's affection is the most elusive prize, and each murder brings her a moment of hope that it will acknowledge her as its favorite. To challenge herself and prove her worthiness, she often sets specific criteria for her kills, such as death in exactly three hits, or from two different directions, or while holding a black rose in her off hand.</p>",
