Her magic manifested early, burning anyone who tried to harm her and keeping her warm when the chief tried to abandon her to die in the cold. She embraced her tribe's love of violence and fire, and loves to use her powers to maim, torture, and kill. She believes she is blessed by the fire gods and meant to use her magic to conquer and destroy. She is a pyromaniac, and has difficulty resisting her urge to ignite flammable objects, creatures, and buildings.</p>",
