When in the presence of a dragon, he hangs on the creature's every word, and is greatly tempted to grovel like a slave. When away from dragons, he is arrogant and condescending, knowing that the dragons have chosen him to interact with lesser races so they do not have to. His greatest hope is to become a dragon disciple so that he can become closer in flesh and spirit to his masters.</p>",
