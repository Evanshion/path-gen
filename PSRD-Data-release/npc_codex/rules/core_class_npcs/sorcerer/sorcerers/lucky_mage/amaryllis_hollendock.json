She trusts her powers to get her through danger alive, but carries a burden of guilt over friends she wasn't able to save. She hides this underneath a veneer of constant cheerfulness and good humor, and is fond of using her magic to delight others and make friends&mdash;though anyone who underestimates her because of her love of clowning and children may find themselves in desperate straits should they rile her anger.</p>",
