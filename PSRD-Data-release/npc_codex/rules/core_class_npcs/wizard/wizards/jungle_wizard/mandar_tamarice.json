            "body": "<p>Mandar is a hermit living in the jungle, content to go for weeks without speaking to anyone. When dealing with strangers, she deliberately acts savage and bestial so they underestimate her power and knowledge. She sometimes obtains valuable spell components or minor magic items by treating them like trinkets, thereby keeping anyone from realizing how valuable they actually are. Some assume that since Mandar lives in the wild she has a grudge against civilization, like many druids do. This isn't the case; she simply prefers solitude. In fact, she loves some creature comforts, and might trade spellcasting services or information to nearby villages in exchange for food, clothing, or sweets for both herself and her familiar, Eink. This monkey follows her everywhere, and usually shows better street smarts than his master.</p>",
