She is fascinated with the play of light and shadow on physical things, and intensely studies people and objects in order to memorize and understand their shapes and surfaces. She claims that she can create a flawless illusion of anyone she has ever met and anything she has ever touched, and has used her talents for illusion to befuddle, entertain, and confound people for years. She doesn't let herself take anything seriously, even the destruction of her creations&mdash;she is comfortable with the ephemeral and impermanent visualizations of her mind's eye, and knows she can always recreate something that was lost.</p>",
