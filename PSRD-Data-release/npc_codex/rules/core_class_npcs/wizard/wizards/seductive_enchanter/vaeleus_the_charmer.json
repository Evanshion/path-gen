What she can't manage to get with ordinary looks, words, and caresses, she gets by using magic. Many people in whatever town she resides in might consider themselves her greatest lover, best friend, or trusted confidant. Vaeleus has gotten used to her lies and tricks eventually falling apart; she often has to leave town in a hurry when lovers or merchants realize they've been compelled against their will. For Vaeleus, it's a simple enough matter to just find a new town with new targets and new pleasures to experience. She doesn't waste time worrying about the bridges she's burned&mdash;after all, those people aren't worth anything to her now.</p>",
