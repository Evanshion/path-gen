    "body": "<p>As with the NPCs in the other chapters, these characters have a role to play in the campaign story, though normally in a subservient or secondary manner. A village's constable (commoner 9) is tough enough to keep the peace for routine squabbles, but must defer to the PCs when a tribe of orcs begins raiding. The PCs might hire the local blacksmith (expert 6) to arm their hired guards (warriors 3) who'll protect the old fort the heroes just recaptured, but the PCs are still the focus of the campaign and the NPC-class characters are less important to the story than the PCs. You can even use these NPCs as mentors or teachers for low-level characters, with the PCs exceeding the capabilities of their trainers and becoming local legends as \"the greatest students I ever had.\"</p>",
