In a low-magic or gritty campaign, humanoid opponents are the norm and skilled opponents and monsters are rare exceptions; the villain of the campaign may have levels in a PC class, but the rest of his minions are experts and warriors. An evil adversary might use deception or magic to turn a mob against the PCs, forcing the heroes to dispatch their misguided opponents, preferably in a nonlethal way that doesn't give them a reputation as casual murderers.</p>",
