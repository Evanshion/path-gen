    "body": "<p>The Core Rulebook lists sample names for all PC races except humans, as human names vary by region and many fantasy games, including the Pathfinder RPG, take their inspiration from a wide variety of regions and traditions. A sampling of human names representing numerous cultures is given below.</p><p>To get a feel for creating human names that reflect different cultural traditions, languages, and flavors, try searching online for names from real-world nations and cultures more akin to your setting. Even if your setting doesn't have a direct cultural analogue in the real world, baby name websites that allow you to filter by origin and ethnicity can often introduce you to names you're unfamiliar with, as well as naming conventions and constructions that sound realistic and organic. Such sites are great places to harvest NPC names when you're in a hurry.</p>",
