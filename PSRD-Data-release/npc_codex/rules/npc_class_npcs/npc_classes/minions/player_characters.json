    "body": "<p>In some campaigns, the PCs start out as normal people who encounter extraordinary circumstances; the PCs begin play with NPC classes and only later take levels in PC classes (if at all). In other campaigns, the main heroes could each have a minion, and some game sessions focus on what the minions are doing while the heroes are off saving the world. You can use these sample NPCs for these kinds of campaigns, but keep in mind that NPC classes are much less powerful than PC classes and have few or no special class abilities that allow them to deal with special monster attacks and defenses; the characters will have to rely on wits and skills to overcome challenges, and combats should be limited to other NPC-class characters and common animals, or else the PCs may die quickly.</p>",
