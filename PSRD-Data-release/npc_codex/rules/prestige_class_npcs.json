However, the prerequisites mean characters with a prestige class tend to be higher level and might require specific kinds of multiclassing to be effective. The <span class=\"char-style-override-8\">NPC Codex saves busy GMs the time it would take to create NPCs with prestige classes.</span></p><p>This section gives you useful and interesting NPCs at prestige class levels 2, 4, 7, and 10 for each of the 10 prestige classes detailed in the Core Rulebook. The NPCs are character levels 9, 13, 17, and 20, allowing you to use them over a wide range of levels in the campaign.</p><p>All of the NPCs in this chapter use the \"heroic\" set of base ability scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8), and the value of their gear has been determined using the Heroic Level column of the NPC Gear table.</p><p>In general, the NPCs do not list mundane gear such as rope, torches, belt pouches, and so on unless it is vital to the character (clerics have a holy symbol, rogues with Disable Device have thieves' tools, and so on). You can assume that an NPC is geared appropriately for his or her profession or adventuring career, and if cost is ever a factor, you can mark off some of the character's extra gear for this purpose or swap it for expendable items such as potions, nearly expended wands, and so on.</p><p>As with the core classes, the three most common uses for NPCs in this chapter are as enemies, allies, and player characters, and the same guidelines explained there apply to this chapter. If your campaign requires PCs to train with a member of a prestige class before they can take levels in that prestige class, you may wish to use these NPCs as mentors or trainers for PCs interested in pursuing these specific courses of study.</p>",

You can even hand-wave the minor math differences between the classes (such as the Hit Die type of a summoner compared to that of a wizard) and create an NPC with a very different feel. For example, the tournament champion (arcane archer 4) is a bard/sorcerer, but could easily be a summoner/sorcerer or a bard/witch, which presents a very different concept for the character.</p>",

Therefore, the four duelists presented here all have fighter or rogue levels.

However, because the prestige class abilities don't alter the base class's abilities or have specific ties to the character's field of study, you can swap out class levels or change the knowledge focus to whatever you need for your campaign.

His unorthodox tactics were mocked at first, with some seeing him as cowardly for not standing and fighting with feet planted like a normal dwarven warrior, but as the corpses of the clan's enemies mounted into piles, then great mounds, the whispers and jokes died.
