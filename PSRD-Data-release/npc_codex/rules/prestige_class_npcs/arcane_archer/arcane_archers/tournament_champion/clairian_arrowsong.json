From an early age, Clairian showed promise as both an excellent archer and bard, despite her parents' misgivings about both \"hobbies.\" In the hours she was supposed to be studying in solitude, she escaped to hear the orators and bards who congregated outside of the city's university. But not until she saw her first archery tournament did she find her real passion. None but her parents were surprised when, as a young woman, she ran away with a sorcerer who served as a soothsayer on the tournament circuit. </p>",
