She started with simple scores, but her love of thieving quickly turned into an addiction. Like most addicts, she needed more potent fixes over time. It didn't take her long to discover that wizards, sorcerers, and other arcane spellcasters are extremely crafty when safeguarding their treasures. They present unique challenges that, when overcome, provide the rush she craves.</p>",
