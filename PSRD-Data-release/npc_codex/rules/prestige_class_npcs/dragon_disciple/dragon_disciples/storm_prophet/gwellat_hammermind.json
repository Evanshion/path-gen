Denied this dream for most of his young life, he grew resentful. His bitterness turned into anger that struck as fast as lightning, and the magical powers he manifested were just as unpredictable and destructive. Upon reaching adulthood, he learned the secret of his true heritage. Angry that the secret was kept from him for so long, he unleashed his most destructive spells on his clan, killing many of them. He fled his home to chase the storms he always longed to be a part of.</p>",
