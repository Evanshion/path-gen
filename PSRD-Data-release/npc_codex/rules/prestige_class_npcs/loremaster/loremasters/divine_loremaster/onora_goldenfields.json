Loving knowledge for its own sake, she joined the clergy of the god of wealth so she'd have good connections and resources to help her collect rare books and increase the stores of knowledge she's already begun to accumulate. But as her studies progressed, she became weary of the inaccuracies and blatant lies she found in secondary sources, and decided she needed to seek out knowledge in a more direct way. Now she travels with any adventuring group that will journey to a place where she can gain knowledge of the world or history firsthand. She swears that her own historical and philosophical treatises and volumes will be far more accurate than the ones written by her predecessors.</p>",
