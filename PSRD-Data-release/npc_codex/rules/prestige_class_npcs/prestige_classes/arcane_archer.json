    "body": "<p>This prestige class requires the ability to cast 1st-level arcane spells, so all four of the arcane archers in this chapter have at least one level in bard, sorcerer, or wizard. If you want to alter the flavor of these characters, you can swap levels in these core classes for levels in a similar arcane spellcasting class such as summoner or witch. You can even hand-wave the minor math differences between the classes (such as the Hit Die type of a summoner compared to that of a wizard) and create an NPC with a very different feel. For example, the tournament champion (arcane archer 4) is a bard/sorcerer, but could easily be a summoner/sorcerer or a bard/witch, which presents a very different concept for the character.</p>",
