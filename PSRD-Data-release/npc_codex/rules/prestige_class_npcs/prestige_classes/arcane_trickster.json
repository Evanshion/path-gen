    "body": "<p>This prestige class requires sneak attack +2d6, so all of the arcane tricksters presented here have at least three levels in the rogue class. The requirement that the character must be able to cast <i>mage hand</i> means the character must have levels in bard, sorcerer, or wizard, so all of the arcane tricksters are multiclassed with rogue and one of those three classes. You could, however, replace the rogue levels in any of these characters with ninja. levels, since the ninja is a modified rogue. The sandman bard archetype and vivisectionist alchemist archetype also give the sneak attack ability and would be interesting class swaps for arcane tricksters.</p>",
