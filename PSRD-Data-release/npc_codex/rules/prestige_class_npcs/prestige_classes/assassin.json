    "body": "<p>This prestige class has the easiest requirements to meet (in terms of game mechanics) out of any of the core classes, so the four assassins presented here have a variety of base classes&mdash;a cleric/rogue, a druid/fighter, a monk, and a rogue. This gives you many options when it comes to quickly customizing these assassins to suit your campaign without altering much of the math. The cleric/rogue could be an oracle/rogue, a cleric/bard, or druid/rogue. The monk could be a fighter, ranger, or rogue. The druid/fighter could be a druid/barbarian, druid/ranger, or cleric/fighter. The rogue could be a bard, ninja, or even a summoner.</p>",
