    "body": "<p>This class requires levels in a spontaneous-casting arcane class (of which there are only two core examples, the bard and sorcerer), and if the character has sorcerer levels, it requires him to have the draconic bloodline, so this prestige class is perhaps the most specialized from the Core Rulebook. Fortunately, changing the character's dragon type is very easy, allowing you to use these four characters as any of the 10 dragon types listed in the sorcerer class.</p>",
