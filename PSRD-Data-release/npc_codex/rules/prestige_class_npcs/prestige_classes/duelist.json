    "body": "<p>This class requires three combat feats, so it is naturally suited for fighters (and to a lesser extent rogues, who can use rogue talents to gain extra combat feats). Its reliance on using intelligent tactics, wearing light or no armor, wielding a light or one-handed piercing weapon, and having a free hand makes it a suboptimal choice for barbarians (whose rage-based abilities are a poor thematic match), monks (as they can fight without weapons, and there is only one monk weapon they can use with duelist class abilities), paladins (who usually wear heavier armor), and rangers (who for the most part either are archers or fight in melee with two weapons). Therefore, the four duelists presented here all have fighter or rogue levels. Because the duelist doesn't use specific fighter or rogue class features as requirements, you can easily swap out these features with those of another archetype, such as the free hand fighter, mobile fighter, acrobat rogue, or rake rogue, to create a new duelist with this stat block.</p>",
