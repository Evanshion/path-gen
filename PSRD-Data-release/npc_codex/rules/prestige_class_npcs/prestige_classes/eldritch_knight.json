    "body": "<p>This class requires proficiency in all martial weapons and 3rd-level arcane spellcasting, so the character must have levels in barbarian, fighter, paladin, or ranger (the only way to gain proficiency in all martial weapons from the Core Rulebook), and levels in bard, sorcerer, or wizard. Though the theme of this class is mostly taken over by the magus base class, using the prestige class lets you do things that you can't do as a single-classed magus, such as using higher-level spells or arcane spells that aren't on the magus spell list, mixing arcane and divine magic (as the champion of magic eldritch knight does), and using barbarian rage. In most cases, you can swap out the character's spellcasting class for another (such as replacing conjurer levels with summoner levels or sorcerer levels with bard levels) or swap her martial class levels for another martial class (ranger for barbarian, cavalier for fighter, and so on).</p>",
