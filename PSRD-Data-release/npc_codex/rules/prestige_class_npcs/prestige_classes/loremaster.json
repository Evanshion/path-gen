    "body": "<p>Because this class's skill, feat, and spell requirements are very specific and its unique class abilities are not particularly useful in combat, characters of this class are often relegated to NPC status as sages or mentors. The four loremasters presented here focus on knowledge of the gods, nature, humanoid history, and the planes. However, because the prestige class abilities don't alter the base class's abilities or have specific ties to the character's field of study, you can swap out class levels or change the knowledge focus to whatever you need for your campaign. For example, if you need a 9th-level planar expert, use the divine loremaster and swap her Knowledge (planes) and Knowledge (religion) skill bonuses.</p>",
