    "body": "<p>This class requires three or more levels of investment in two different spellcasting classes, and a character interested in this path usually can't afford to dip into other classes on the way to taking prestige class levels. One of the two unique class abilities of the mystic theurge is the ability to use spell slots from one class to cast spells from the character's other class. However, because doing so makes the spell use a higher-level spell slot than normal, this is a suboptimal choice&mdash;the character would normally do this only if he needed extra castings of certain spells and didn't have enough spell slots of the right class. Rather than presenting an underpowered character with weaker-than-normal spells, the four mystic theurges in this chapter are not depicted as using that class ability. Feel free to alter their spell lists to take advantage of this ability if it suits your campaign.</p>",
