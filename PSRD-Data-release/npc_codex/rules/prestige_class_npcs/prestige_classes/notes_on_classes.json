    "body": "<p>As with the core classes, you always have the option to alter or add to these characters to make them even more useful to your campaign. If you're considering swapping a character's core class abilities for those of another class or archetype, be sure the altered character still qualifies for the prestige class. For example, the arcane trickster class requires a character to have sneak attack +2d6, so don't use a class or rogue archetype that removes the character's sneak attack ability.</p><p>The remainder of this section examines specific alternative class and archetype choices for each of the classes in this chapter.</p>",
