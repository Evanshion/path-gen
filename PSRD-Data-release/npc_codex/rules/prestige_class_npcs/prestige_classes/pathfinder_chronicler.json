    "body": "<p>This class requires a small skill investment and a roleplaying or background requirement that doesn't need a specific class ability and has no effect on the character's stat block; therefore, the example Pathfinder chroniclers represent a variety of classes. As with the example assassin characters, this means you can easy swap base classes to customize these Pathfinder chroniclers to suit your campaign, such as by changing the mad prophet from a cleric to a conjurer, the master storycrafter from a sorcerer to an illusionist, or the battle skald from a barbarian/bard to a ranger/bard.</p>",
