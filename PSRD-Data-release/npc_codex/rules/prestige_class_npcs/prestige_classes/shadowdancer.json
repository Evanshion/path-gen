    "body": "<p>This class requires three combat feats and a small skill investment, so while it is mainly suited for martial characters, it is within reach for spellcasters as well. However, many of the shadowdancer's class abilities&mdash; darkvision, evasion, proficiencies, rogue talents, and uncanny dodge&mdash;are available from other classes or races (or can be emulated with other class abilities), so many characters who take levels in this class will have redundant abilities. Creating an effective shadowdancer requires careful selection of base classes and feats to avoid this; if you swap out earlier levels, make sure you minimize the number of these abilities the character gains from two different sources.</p>",
