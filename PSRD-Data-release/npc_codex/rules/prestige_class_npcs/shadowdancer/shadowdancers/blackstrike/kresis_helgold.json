Possessing no loyalty to any one group, she rarely accepts jobs from the same people twice, and has been known to carry out assassinations for both sides of a single conflict. Sometimes, this means an aggravated employer sends assassins after Kresis herself. In these situations, she retreats rather than staying to fight&mdash;unless she knows one of her would-be killers has a high price on his head that she could claim.</p>",

In times of doubt, she leaves the fate of her prey to a simple coin toss. If the result favors the victim, she doesn't accept the money she was promised for the job, and leaves it at that.

She takes as few personal risks as possible, and makes sure she's prepared before a battle so she can fight on her own terms. Once a mercenary, she turned to assassination in order to have more control over her actions and lower her own risk of death, and she's not about to stick her neck out now. She almost never fights in the middle of the day, preferring to attack at night or near dusk or dawn when the shadows are long. </p>",
