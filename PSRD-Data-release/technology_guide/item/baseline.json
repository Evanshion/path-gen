    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">An injection of baseline floods the brain with neuroinhibitors that purge the mind of excess emotion. Baseline has an onset time of 10 minutes. When it takes effect, baseline renders the recipient immune to insanity, mind-affecting effects, and morale bonuses for 1 hour, as well as suppressing (but not removing) any such active, ongoing effects. It can be resisted with a successful DC 14 Fortitude saving throw. Once a creature has been affected by baseline, it cannot be affected by additional doses for 24 hours.</p>",
