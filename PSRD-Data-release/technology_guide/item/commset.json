    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This handheld device allows for communication between two commset users. A commset carries audio and visual signals, and includes a built-in camera that can record all communications being broadcast. Communication between two commsets requires both users to tune their individual devices to the same frequency. A commset has a range of 1 mile&mdash;beyond this range, communication is impossible without enhancing the signal strength with a signal booster. The price and cost listed for this item are for a single commset.</p>",
