    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A cybernetic arm completely replaces a normal arm, from the shoulder to the hand. It can take the place of an arm lost to a severing wound. The arm is fully functional and no different in appearance from a regular arm, although cyberart can be added to the arm at no additional cost. A cybernetic arm does not increase a user's Strength score. If a creature has two cybernetic arms, it can lift and carry double the normal maximum weight for that creature's Strength and size, and it gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Climb checks. A character who wields a one-handed or light weapon with a cybernetic arm gains a +5 bonus to CMD against disarm attempts; two cybernetic arms do not increase this bonus, but do allow the bonus to apply to two-handed weapons.</p>",
