    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A dart gun makes use of nanotechnology to craft a small pointed projectile that does minimal damage on its own. Unlike other nanotech weapons, the nanites that make up a dart do not have any additional effect on the target. Instead, a dart gun contains a small reservoir above its handle into which a single dose of a pharmaceutical, drug, poison, or even potion can be poured as a standard action. The next dart fired from the dart gun delivers that liquid into the target immediately upon a hit.</p>",
