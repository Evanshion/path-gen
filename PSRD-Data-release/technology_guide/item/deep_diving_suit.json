    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A deep diving suit is a body-tight mesh of reinforced rubber and polymer fitted with scrubbers that can draw and purify oxygen from its surrounding environment, extracting oxygen from water as easily as from air. The suit's helmet is close-fitting but offers excellent visibility, while the suit's fabric itself can flex while still remaining supportive against pressure&mdash;depths are treated as being 1,000 feet shallower than their actual depth for the purposes of determining pressure damage from deep water. The wearer is also immune to inhaled toxins and can breathe underwater with ease&mdash;the suit does not allow breathing in a vacuum.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A diving suit's hands and feet can activate webbing, long fins, and flippers, which the wearer can extend (and deactivate) as a move action. While in this mode, the wearer of the suit gains a swim speed of 20 feet and a +8 bonus on Swim checks, but the armor check penalty of the suit doubles to -4 and its land speed reduces to 20 feet (or 15 feet for slower characters, as appropriate). Swim checks are never penalized by a diving suit's armor check penalty.</p>",
