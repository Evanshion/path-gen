    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Goo tubes are a form of preserved food. A single goo tube is a malleable cylinder with a cap on one end; when it's opened and squeezed, the colorful, goopy contents are extruded. Although the texture and appearance of this goo is unappetizing, the paste is actually quite tasty, and comes in a mind-boggling assortment of flavors. A symbol on the side of the tube often grants a clue as to what flavor may be contained within, but these symbols can sometimes be counter-intuitive. The contents of a single goo tube can provide nourishment for a day for one Medium-size creature.</p>",
