    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A gravity clip is a small, disc-shaped device that can be attached to any melee weapon. Once mounted, the clip modulates the weapon's mass on the moment of impact, via the manipulation of the gravity fields around the weapon. Each successful hit against a target consumes a charge from a gravity clip and causes the damage from the hit to resolve as if the weapon were one size category larger than its actual size. This effect does not stack with similar effects, such as those granted by the spell <i>lead blades</i>.</p>",
