    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Known also as an \"H-belt,\" a heavy weapon harness is an elaborate network of plastic and metal struts and straps. The harness can be worn in conjunction with any other suit of armor&mdash;the armor bonus granted by the heavy weapon harness does not stack with that granted by other suits of armor, but the armor check penalties and spell failure percentages do.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A heavy weapon harness provides its wearer with additional stability and support, allowing the user to wield heavy weapons as if they were regular firearms, using the Exotic Weapon (firearms) feat for proficiency rather than Exotic Weapon (heavy weaponry). A character with Exotic Weapon (heavy weaponry) who wears an H-belt finds the use of heavy weapons even easier, and gains a +1 circumstance bonus on all attack rolls made with harnessed heavy weapons.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Unlike most technological armors, a heavy weapon harness does not use power&mdash;its components are purely mechanical.</p>",
