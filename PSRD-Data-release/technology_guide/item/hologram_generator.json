It manipulates photons and sound waves to produce highly realistic images and sounds, similar in nature to those generated by figment illusions.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Before a hologram generator can generate an image, though, it must store the image in its memory. The maximum size and maximum number of images a generator can store vary according to its color, but storing an image is a standard action regardless of the strength of the generator. More powerful generators can store moving images and sounds, or even generate illusions that interact with their environments.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Once a hologram generator's memory is full, additional images overwrite existing images as chosen by the user at the time of their recording.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Generating a hologram is a standard action. If the hologram generator is then left alone, it continues to project the image until it depletes its charges. Alternatively, the user can aim the hologram at a different location as a move action.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A hologram generator is a color-coded item, and the particulars of its abilities, including its energy capacity, the range at which it can create its holograms, and the Will save DC to disbelieve the hologram if it is interacted with, vary as detailed below.</p>",
