    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A potent fusion of magic, advanced science, and masterful weaponsmithing, <i>null blades</i> were devised as weapons against both magic and machine. <i>Null blades</i> incorporate an adamantine-noqual alloy in their blades, a closely guarded metallurgical secret. These weapons closely guarded, and when one falls into another's hands, they spare no expense in their efforts to recover it.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A <i>null blade</i> is a <i>+1 construct-bane bastard sword</i>&mdash;using it in this capacity does not consume any charges. The blade's strange alloy penetrates hardness as if it were made of adamantine. The blade can be activated as a swift action. While it's active, a shimmering field of green energy wraps around the blade, disrupting magic and technology alike, and the weapon's enhancement bonus increases to +2. In addition, the first time in a round that an activated <i>null blade</i> strikes a creature or object, it consumes an additional charge and targets the creature or object struck with <i>dispel magic</i> and <i>discharge</i>. If a technological item damaged by a <i>null blade</i> is used in the same round it took damage, it glitches as if it were timeworn.</p>",
