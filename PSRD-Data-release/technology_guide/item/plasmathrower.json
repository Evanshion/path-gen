    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A plasmathrower is a devastating weapon that fires blasts of superheated, electrically charged gas. This weapon has two firing modes: slow-firing and automatic. When used on the slow-firing setting, the weapon fires a scattering shot with no range increment; on the automatic setting, it fires individual bursts of plasma that can reach up to 3 range increments. Half the damage dealt by a plasmathrower is fire damage and the other half is electricity damage.</p>",
