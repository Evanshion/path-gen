    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This silvery box holds up to 1 cubic foot of items or material. Quantum boxes always exist as a pair. When activated as a standard action, a quantum box connects to its mate, at which point they trade contents. A quantum box must be activated again to switch the contents back. Effects that prevent dimensional travel block activation of a quantum box, but items that block signals do not. This effect works only if both quantum boxes are located on the same plane.</p>",
