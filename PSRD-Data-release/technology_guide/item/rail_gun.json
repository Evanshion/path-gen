    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A rail gun uses gravitons to compress raw metal scrap placed in its sequencing chamber into hyperdense shells that it then accelerates to astounding speed and fires from its electromagnetically charged barrel. The weapon's rate of fire is slow compared to most other technological weapons, yet its relatively high damage combined with its potential for particularly grisly critical hits makes it a much sought-after weapon for long-range combat. Shots fired from a rail gun bypass an object's first 10 points of hardness, and can completely penetrate targets without hardness.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">When making an attack with a rail gun, make a single attack roll and compare that result to the ACs of all creatures in a line extending out to the weapon's maximum range. This weapon damages all targets with an AC equal to or lower than the attack roll. However, if the attack's damage fails to penetrate any target's hardness or damage reduction, this shot is blocked and cannot damage targets that are farther away.</p>",
