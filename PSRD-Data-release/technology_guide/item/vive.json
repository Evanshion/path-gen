    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Vive revitalizes the body at the cost of mental acuity. This pharmaceutical has an onset time of 1 minute. It eliminates fatigue and exhaustion and heals 1d4 points of ability damage to a physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution) of the target's choice. The first dose taken in a 24-hour period deals 1d2 points of ability damage to Intelligence and Wisdom; additional doses in that period deal 1d4 points of ability damage instead. Vive can be resisted with a successful DC 12 Fortitude saving throw. </p>",
