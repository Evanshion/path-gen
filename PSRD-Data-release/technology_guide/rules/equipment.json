The beams of radiation created when the wielder fires an atom gun do not fill the cone in a homogeneous area, and she must still make a ranged touch attack to irradiate a target. A creature struck by an atom gun attack suffers the effects of medium radiation. The small core of radioactive material in an atom gun is powerful enough to keep the weapon charged for tens of thousands of years, but the weapon becomes incredibly hot when fired, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the user and subsequently beginning a cool-down protocol, during which the weapon cannot be fired for 1 minute.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">An atom gun cannot be fired more than 3 times per day. A functional atom gun's power source is shielded well, and the gun itself is not a source of dangerous radioactivity. If an atom gun gains the broken condition, it begins to leak radiation and becomes a source of low radiation to all creatures that touch it. An atom gun that gains the destroyed condition becomes a source of high radiation to those in contact with it, a source of medium radiation to those within 10 feet of it, and a source of low radiation to those within 30 feet of it.</p>",

An autograpnel's cord is long enough to allow the grapnel to reach its maximum range of 300 feet, and the internal retraction motors are strong enough to hold up to 500 pounds of weight. If the grapnel misses its target, it can be rewound into the gun as a standard action; reattaching the grapnel to the gun barrel is a move action.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">An autograpnel strikes with an effective Strength score of 22 for the purposes of determining damage. If it strikes a creature, it remains lodged in the target and connected to the rifle and its wielder by the metal cord. This cord has AC 12, hardness 10, and 20 hp. A successful DC 32 Strength check is required to snap the cord. If the wielder retracts the cord while it's attached to a creature, the autograpnel attempts a pull combat maneuver check with a CMB of +16.

When this weapon is fired, the three barrels release a beam of gravitons that spiral around each other to create a 100-foot-long cone-shaped vortex of devastating energy. This energy tears, crushes, and twists everything in its path. Being struck by a vortex gun induces overwhelming vertigo in living victims. A living creature damaged by a vortex gun must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw to avoid being nauseated for 1 round. A critical hit also allows the user of the gun to attempt a trip combat maneuver check against the target (CMB = user's base attack bonus + 15); this attempt doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Flying creatures struck by a vortex gun are affected as if they were struck by hurricane force winds. A creature protected by a force field takes no damage from a vortex gun but must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex save or the shot automatically depletes all of the force field's remaining hit points.</p>",

Among certain societies, access cards are also used as decorations, worn as affectations, and incorporated into ceremonial regalia.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Access cards must be encoded to specific locks before they can function. Often, all of the doors in a complex are keyed to a unique set of cards that don't work on doors found in other complexes, much like a skeleton key might open all the doors in one castle but none in another.

While one can use the electricity provided by a generator, these are rare, expensive, and rarely portable. It's more common and practical to charge such items with batteries. A battery looks like a small silver disk that's etched with strange lines&mdash;some people have taken to calling batteries \"silverdisks\" and sometimes use them as coins. A battery contains 10 charges when full; to charge an item with a battery, one simply slips the disk-shaped device into the proper slot on the item. The battery's charge instantly fully depletes, and the item's internal capacitors fill with 10 charges as it does so. If the item had fewer than 10 open slots in its capacity, the excess charges the battery once held are lost. A battery can be kept within an object indefinitely, or it can be ejected from the object for the purposes of recharging it or storing it elsewhere without affecting the item's charge. Inserting or ejecting a battery is a move action.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Placing a battery in a generator's charging slot can recharge it. However, each time a battery is recharged, there's a 20% chance that the battery is destroyed in the process. A destroyed battery is worth only 10 gp. The bulk of \"silverdisks\" in circulation today are destroyed batteries; one can tell a functional battery from a destroyed one by the way the circuitry seems to shimmer slightly when reflecting light. The circuitry in a charged battery glows with a soft blue radiance equal to that of a candle.</p>",

Over the course of the next 12 hours, the clonepod works nonstop to produce an exact replica of the creature from which the genetic material was harvested, as the creature was when the sample was taken. A clonepod can only duplicate a Medium or smaller creature&mdash;attempts to clone a larger creature result in a hideous, partially formed monstrosity that heaves and gasps a few times before dying.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The completed clone can remain in stasis inside the pod indefinitely as long as the seals are not broken. The clone created is alive, yet has no mind until a neurocam is used to upload a mind into the clone's brain. A clone has the same Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the original body. A clone that is awoken before any mind is uploaded into it has no Intelligence score, and its Wisdom and Charisma scores are both 1.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Uploading a mind from a neurocam into a clone takes 10 minutes. If the mind belonged to the same creature that was used to grow the clone, it immediately comes back to life as if under the effects of a <i>clone</i> spell (including 2 negative levels or 2 points of Constitution drain)&mdash;provided the user's soul has not yet passed to the Boneyard and been judged.  It possesses the same Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma of the original mind, all of that creature's skills, and most of the memories and personality of the creature (though there may be gaps or differences). A mind uploaded into a clone after its soul has been judged results in a soulless approximation of the original. Such a creature has its Charisma permanently reduced by 2 points (which cannot be restored), and has no ability to grow more powerful or gain levels (similar to a <i>simulacrum</i>).</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If the clone's body and mind are not from the same source, all six ability scores are permanently reduced by 2 points.</p>",

The gun is shaped like a hefty syringe with a handle and a small touch screen on which parameters can be programmed and adjusted to focus the nanites on a specific ability to augment. It can be programmed to enhance a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score. Setting a cortex gun to affect one of these six abilities requires a character with the Technologist feat succeeding at a DC 20 Linguistics check. On a failure, the programming is scrambled and nonfunctional until properly set. When a cortex gun is found as treasure, roll 1d8 to determine which ability score it's programmed to, with a result of 7-8 indicating that it's currently scrambled.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A cortex gun is used by placing the tip against the target's forehead and pulling the trigger as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. This causes an adamantine needle to bore into the skull; the target must then succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw to resist being stunned for 2d6 rounds. On a success, he's merely staggered for 1d4 rounds. If the cortex gun's programming was scrambled, the nanites die without doing any harm or aid to the target.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If the cortex gun was properly programmed to one of the six ability scores, the nanites swiftly disperse through the user's body, enhancing and augmenting that ability score over the course of several days. These augmentations are inherent bonuses, and increase the ability score by 1 every 24 hours that pass until the cortex gun's maximum bonus is reached.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A cortex gun can only function on living corporeal creatures, but a living creature with a bonus granted by a cortex gun that dies and becomes undead retains that bonus in undeath.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A cortex gun can only be used once before it becomes useless.

The shelter includes pneumatic spike anchors that can attach it to any ground cover of hardness 8 or less. Several windows allow those inside to see outside. The interior contains several fluorescent lights. The shelter can withstand winds of up to 120 mph, and provides excellent insulation for those inside, maintaining a temperature between 50 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. A small combination heater/air scrubber set on the floor near the entrance to the shelter controls the temperature and purifies any noxious external air into breathable air. The hut has fire resistance 20, cold resistance 20, and acid resistance 10. The dense plastic walls have hardness 8 and 10 hit points. The hut cannot float on water. The door is self-sealing, allowing anyone inside an emergency shelter to live in inhospitable conditions with ease for as long as the power holds out. As long as no foreign objects or creatures remain inside an emergency shelter, it can be commanded at the touch of a button to compact back down into its portable shape over the course of 1 minute. After this point, the device consumes 1 charge over the course of 8 hours resetting its internal structure, limiting its deployment to 3 times a day at most.</p>",

When activated as a standard action, dozens of tiny biofeedback needles pierce the wearer's arms to interface with the nervous system; this process is somewhat painful and the wearer must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being dazed for 1 round as the force field is activated. Once active, the device generates an invisible and intangible field of force around the target. The force field blocks solids and liquids, but not gases or light (including laser beams). The user of a force field can still breathe, but she cannot eat or drink.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Activating a force field is a standard action that consumes 1 charge, after which point the field consumes 1 additional charge every minute it remains active. While a force field is active, the user gains a number of temporary hit points that varies depending on the force field's power. All damage dealt to the wearer of a force field is subtracted from the temporary hit points it grants first. As long as the force field is active, the wearer is immune to critical hits (but not precision-based damage, such as sneak attacks). A force field has fast healing that replenishes its temporary hit points at a fixed rate each round, but if the force field's temporary hit points are ever reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and cannot be reactivated for 24 hours. Force fields are automatically reduced to 0 hp by disintegration effects. A force field can be deactivated as a free action.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The charge capacity, amount of temporary hit points granted, and rate of fast healing these temporary hit points have varies according to the force field's color code, as detailed below.</p>",

A roll of ion tape fits in the palm of a hand and comes in a wide range of colors. A single roll contains 50 feet of tape. A single strip of tape is easy to cut through or tear. When wrapped around an object, it has a weak adhesive that keeps it in place. When ion tape is exposed to an electrical charge of any power (including a jolt from a zip stick), the tape bonds together into a single mass of plastic-like material, gaining hardness 8 and 30 hit points. When used to bind a creature, a few strips of activated ion tape require a successful DC 28 Strength check to break. A second jolt from an electrical source causes the tape to revert to its weaker ribbon condition, at which point it can be torn free easily. A strip of ion tape can hold about 5 pounds of weight normally, but when activated via a jolt, a single hardened strip can support up to 300 pounds of weight. The uses for ion tape are many&mdash;it can be used to construct basic objects (such as a ladder), patch holes, bind prisoners, and so on.</p>",

The device can also be used to encode an electronic lock to a different color code of access, allowing it to be opened by lower-rated access cards. A lock coder can code any color access equal to or lower than its color. Encoding an access card or an electronic lock requires a successful Disable Device check as if the user were attempting to disable an electronic device. The DC to encode a lock or card to a specific color code is given on the table below (these DCs are equal to the DCs required to use Disable Device to pick the locks). It takes 1 minute to use a lock coder. The user can take 20 on this check if the lock coder isn't timeworn. An e-pick can be used with a lock coder to increase the chance of success; for locks with a higher color rating, an e-pick is all but required even for the most gifted of technicians. See Skills for more information on how the Disable Device skill works in regard to technology.</p>",

This device is used to make a duplicate of a creature's mind, copying and storing all the knowledge, memories, and personality of a living creature. A neurocam can be adjusted to fit the head of any creature of size Tiny to Large. A neurocam interfaces with the subject's brain via a modulated beam of light that is transmitted through the optic nerves and several fine sensors that must press against the user's skull. Storing a person's mind takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted use; any interruption scrambles the pattern and ruins the neurocam. This process does not harm the target. An unwilling subject can attempt a DC 20 Will saving throw to resist a neurocam; if the subject is successful, the neurocam's contents are scrambled and the device is ruined.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A neurocam can store only one personality. Once used, it cannot store another even after the contents are uploaded elsewhere. A personality stored in a neurocam is effectively put into stasis&mdash;the mind does not age, nor does it gain new experiences or knowledge. It's cut off from the world, and though it experiences strange dreams, it isn't aware of the passage of time. If the neurocam is destroyed, the stored personality vanishes; however, loss of power does not harm a stored personality. </p><p class=\"stat-block\">A stored personality can be uploaded only once. It can be uploaded into a blank clone in a clonepod.
