    "body": "<p>Cybertech is a form of technology that must be surgically implanted into a host body before it functions. Cybertech takes up a special set of slots that correspond to a creature's body. Most cybertech is designed for a creature with a humanoid shape&mdash;installing cybertech in a non-humanoid-shaped body is more difficult, but possible.</p><p>Each piece of cybertech has an implantation value that indicates how invasive the implant is. The total combined implantation values of all cybertech implanted in a single creature can't exceed either that creature's Constitution score or Intelligence score&mdash;a creature's Constitution sets the physical limit of what its body can accept in the form of cybernetic implants, while the creature's Intelligence sets the mental limit of what its brain can control. An implant whose implantation value would cause the total to exceed either of these two scores does not function but still takes up a body slot. In addition, as long as a character has cybernetic implants installed whose combined implantation exceeds his Constitution or Intelligence, he takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws.</p><p>A creature with neither a Constitution score nor an Intelligence score cannot receive benefits from cybertech, but a creature with only one of these scores can.</p><p>Installing a piece of cybertech takes a number of hours equal to the cybertech's implantation value if the installation is done by hand&mdash;certain technological items can speed this installation time. The target must be willing or helpless during the entire installation, at the end of which the installer attempts a Heal check against the cybertech's Install DC&mdash;this specific value is listed for each cybertech item. On a success, the target takes Constitution damage equal to the cybertech's implantation value and the cybertech immediately activates. On a failed check, the target still takes the Constitution damage but the installation fails; a new attempt to install the cybertech can be made, although it's wise to wait for the Constitution damage to heal before trying again.</p><p>Cybertech can be extracted using the same procedure as implanting it, with a failed Heal check indicating the attempt to extract the item failed. Fortunately, extraction is a simpler task than installment, and Heal checks to remove cybertech gain a +10 bonus. Extracting a piece of cybertech from a dead body requires no Heal check but takes a number of rounds equal to the cybertech's implantation value. You can only install or extract a single piece of cybertech at a time.</p><p>An NPC generally charges an amount equal to 1/10 the total price of a piece of cybertech for the service of installing the item.</p><p>Each piece of cybertech has a full description, including a set of abbreviated statistics at the start.
