    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">An emergency beacon is a small, pod-shaped device that emits a bright red flash from a dome on its top once every 6 seconds when activated. The beacon also transmits its location. Any device capable of receiving signals of any sort can pick up a beacon's signal, which can then be tracked back to the source with a successful DC 15 Knowledge (engineering) or Survival check. A beacon's transmissions have a range of 100 miles over flat terrain, but this range is halved in forests or hills, and quartered in mountainous terrain or through water.</p>",
