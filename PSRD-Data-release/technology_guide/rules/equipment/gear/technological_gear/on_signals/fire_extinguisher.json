    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This cylindrical device has a nozzle at one end and a handle on one side. When activated as a standard action, a fire extinguisher creates a 15-foot cone of misty vapor that swiftly extinguishes fires within its area of effect. Against magical fire effects, such as those created by a <i>wall of fire</i> or similar spell, the fire extinguisher only extinguishes the part of the larger effect its vapors directly contact. Continual magic flames, such as those of a <i>flaming</i> weapon or fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds before they automatically reignite. To extinguish an instantaneous fire effect or spell, the wielder must use a readied action with the fire extinguisher to counter the effect; this can cancel the entire effect, provided the source of the effect is in the extinguisher's area of effect.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">When used against a creature of the fire subtype, a blast from a fire extinguisher deals 4d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 15 halves). A breathing creature exposed to a direct blast from a fire extinguisher is not harmed as long as the area is relatively well-ventilated&mdash;using a fire extinguisher in a confined area with poor or no ventilation can result in slow suffocation (at the GM's discretion).</p>",
