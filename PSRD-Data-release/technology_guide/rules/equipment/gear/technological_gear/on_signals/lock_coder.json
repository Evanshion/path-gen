The device can also be used to encode an electronic lock to a different color code of access, allowing it to be opened by lower-rated access cards. A lock coder can code any color access equal to or lower than its color. Encoding an access card or an electronic lock requires a successful Disable Device check as if the user were attempting to disable an electronic device. The DC to encode a lock or card to a specific color code is given on the table below (these DCs are equal to the DCs required to use Disable Device to pick the locks). It takes 1 minute to use a lock coder. The user can take 20 on this check if the lock coder isn't timeworn. An e-pick can be used with a lock coder to increase the chance of success; for locks with a higher color rating, an e-pick is all but required even for the most gifted of technicians. See Skills for more information on how the Disable Device skill works in regard to technology.</p>",
