    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This wand-like device contains a reservoir at one end and a small pad at the other. A medlance can be filled with a single dose of liquid, such as a pharmaceutical, a potion, or a poison. It can then be used to administer the liquid to a creature&mdash;if the target does not wish to be injected with the medlance's contents, the wielder must succeed at a touch attack to dispense it as a standard action. Otherwise, administering liquid via a medlance is a move action. A medlance doesn't use charges, but after being used to administer 10 injections, its internal sterilization mechanisms are depleted and the device becomes useless.</p>",
