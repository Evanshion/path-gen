The device monitors and interprets motion in a 30-foot radius, but must be deployed in a sweeping motion to function&mdash;this is a move action that consumes a charge. When used, the device grants a +10 circumstance bonus on Perception checks against moving objects within 30 feet that are size Tiny or larger.</p>",
