    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A robojack is a strange, rod-like device that can be used to usurp control of an otherwise functional robot. In order to gain control of a robot, the wielder must first make a ranged touch attack against a target robot within a range of 60 feet. If the attack is successful, the robot must succeed at a DC 14 Will saving throw to prevent the robojack from linking to the robot's command processor. On a subsequent turn after a link is established, the wielder can issue a command to the robot as a standard action&mdash;each attempt to do so consumes 1 charge from the robojack, and the robot gets a new DC 14 Will saving throw to resist following each command. The wielder must be within 60 feet of the robot and must issue the command in a language understood by the robot. The types of commands he can issue are similar to those allowed by a <i>suggestion</i> spell&mdash;once a command is successfully issued, the robot does its best to carry out the orders over the course of the next hour. This does not drain further charges from the robojack.</p>",
