The beams of radiation created when the wielder fires an atom gun do not fill the cone in a homogeneous area, and she must still make a ranged touch attack to irradiate a target. A creature struck by an atom gun attack suffers the effects of medium radiation. The small core of radioactive material in an atom gun is powerful enough to keep the weapon charged for tens of thousands of years, but the weapon becomes incredibly hot when fired, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the user and subsequently beginning a cool-down protocol, during which the weapon cannot be fired for 1 minute.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">An atom gun cannot be fired more than 3 times per day. A functional atom gun's power source is shielded well, and the gun itself is not a source of dangerous radioactivity. If an atom gun gains the broken condition, it begins to leak radiation and becomes a source of low radiation to all creatures that touch it. An atom gun that gains the destroyed condition becomes a source of high radiation to those in contact with it, a source of medium radiation to those within 10 feet of it, and a source of low radiation to those within 30 feet of it.</p>",

An autograpnel's cord is long enough to allow the grapnel to reach its maximum range of 300 feet, and the internal retraction motors are strong enough to hold up to 500 pounds of weight. If the grapnel misses its target, it can be rewound into the gun as a standard action; reattaching the grapnel to the gun barrel is a move action.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">An autograpnel strikes with an effective Strength score of 22 for the purposes of determining damage. If it strikes a creature, it remains lodged in the target and connected to the rifle and its wielder by the metal cord. This cord has AC 12, hardness 10, and 20 hp. A successful DC 32 Strength check is required to snap the cord. If the wielder retracts the cord while it's attached to a creature, the autograpnel attempts a pull combat maneuver check with a CMB of +16.
