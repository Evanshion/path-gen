    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A gravity pistol is one of the most advanced pieces of technology found. It uses a focused beam of gravitons to create a bolt of force. A gravity pistol has two settings&mdash;switching between settings is a swift action. On its pulse setting, it can be used as a typical beam weapon, but on it sustained setting, holding the pistol's trigger down creates a stable beam of gravitons rather than a short, destructive burst. In this mode, the gravity pistol can be used to move and manipulate objects at a distance, similar to a <i>telekinesis</i> spell in its sustained force or combat maneuver versions (a gravity pistol cannot duplicate the violent thrust option of a <i>telekinesis</i> spell). In this mode, a gravity pistol consumes 1 charge per round. The graviton beam can move objects weighing no more than 225 pounds up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate this effect on an object in its possession with a successful DC 19 Reflex save. If used to perform a combat maneuver, the beam uses the wielder's CMB, but uses her Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength or Dexterity modifier.</p>",
