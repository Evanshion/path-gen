    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A mindrender is a cruel weapon that emits a carrier wave of light which transmits a mass of nanites into the body of the creature struck. The victim must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or it takes 1 negative level and is staggered for 1 round as the nanites flood the victim's brain and suppress long term memories. If the victim succeeds, he's instead sickened for 1d4 rounds and is immune to further attacks from a mindrender for 1 hour. A creature can attempt a new saving throw every 24 hours to remove the negative level. These are mind-affecting effects.</p>",
