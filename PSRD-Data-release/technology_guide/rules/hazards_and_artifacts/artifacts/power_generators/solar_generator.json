    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A solar generator consists of a fairly small converter attached to a set of huge reflective panels. It produces full yield while receiving direct sunlight. Its yield halves during overcast conditions. At night or when densely overcast, its yield drops to 0. A solar generator runs silently. A solar generator cannot be forced to exceed its yield.</p>",
