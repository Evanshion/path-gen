To destroy an AI in a host structure, either the physical device that contains the AI's programming must be destroyed (the magnitude of this task can vary widely&mdash;the host may be merely a single computer with hardness 10 and 20 hit points or an entire building that must be destroyed over multiple encounters or adventures) or all three of its ability scores must be reduced to 0 via ability drain effects directed at the AI's core processor (typically a large computer in the most well-defended part of a complex, but sometimes a processor housed in a robot). Ability damage dealt to an AI at best merely inconveniences it, and at worst renders it comatose for a limited time.</p><p>An AI that is installed in a robot enhances that robot with the aggregate template.</p>",
