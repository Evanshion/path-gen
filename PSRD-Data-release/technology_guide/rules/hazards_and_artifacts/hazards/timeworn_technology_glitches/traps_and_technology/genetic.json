    "body": "<p>A genetic trigger works in a fashion similar to scent. It can be set to target or not target living creatures within 30 feet (adjusted by wind as for scent) based on an individual, close family, or species relationship. For example, a trap could be set to target orcs, or to not target an NPC and his close relations. Genetic triggers are used in conjunction with other triggers and limit the maximum range of those triggers. A trap can incorporate up to half its CR in different genetic samples and conditions. This trigger adds +1 to the trap's CR and +5 to its crafting DC.</p><p class=\"stat-block-1\" id=\"concealed-laser-turret\">Concealed Laser Turret <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">CR 4</span></p>",
