    "body": "<p id=\"improved-implantation\"> At 7th level, a cyber-soldier can exceed the normal limitations on cybertech implantation. His brain and body slots each accommodate one more piece of cybertech than normal. In addition, his limit on implantation points increases by 1/2 his cyber-soldier level. He can allocate these points between his Intelligence and Constitution scores as he chooses. At 15th level, his body slot can accommodate two more pieces of cybertech than normal. This ability replaces armor training 2 and 4.</p>",
