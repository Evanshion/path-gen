    "body": "<p id=\"sword-and-gun\">At 2nd level, when a raging savage technologist wields a one-handed firearm in one hand and a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other, she can make ranged attacks with the firearm without provoking attacks of opportunity. She also gains the benefits of the Two Weapon Fighting feat, but only if all attacks are made with those weapons. This ability replaces Uncanny Dodge. </p>",
