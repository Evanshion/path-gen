    "body": "<p>New technological items can and should be created, using existing items for inspiration. A new item may resemble an existing magic item, such as how jet packs function like <i>winged boots</i>, but there should be differences beyond just battery power to keep technology distinct. When pricing a new technological item, use the existing guidelines for estimating magic item value. There's no extra cost associated with technological items since they have extra weaknesses to go along with their advantages. Items that use charges should be priced as if they were use-activated, not as if they were charged in the way a wand or <i>ring of the ram</i> is charged, unless the item is disposable and has 50 or fewer charges, as the assumption is that a newly crafted technological item can be recharged with relative ease.</p>",
