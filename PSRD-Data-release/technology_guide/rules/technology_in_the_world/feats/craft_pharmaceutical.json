Creating a pharmaceutical takes 2 hours if its base price is 250 gp or less; otherwise, the creation of the pharmaceutical takes 1 day for every 1,000 gp in its price. To create the pharmaceutical or poison, you must use up raw materials costing half of this total price. See Crafting High-Tech Items for more information.</p>",
