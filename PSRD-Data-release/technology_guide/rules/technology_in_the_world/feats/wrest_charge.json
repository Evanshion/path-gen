Using this charge or failing your check by 5 or more permanently depletes the battery. </p><p class=\"stat-block-1\">You can attempt the same check to add 1 last charge to a discharged piece of timeworn technology. Regardless of the outcome, no other attempts can be made, even by another person. Using this feat takes 1 minute. You can attempt to wrest a charge as a move action by taking a -10 penalty on your check. This feat does not stack with the charge cycling deed.</p>",
