    "body": "<p id=\"arcane-battery\">At 3rd level as a swift action, a technomancer can expend an unused spell slot (if he's a spontaneous caster) or a prepared spell (if he prepares spells) to power a technological device he touches. Each spell level expended in this way grants the device 1 charge. Any charges unused at the end of the round are lost, and any charges used by the device that round that aren't provided by the technomancer must come from the device's own power reserves. He can use this ability to power timeworn technology. He can't power devices that don't use charges.</p>",
