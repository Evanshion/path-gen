    "body": "<p id=\"command-robot\">At 5th level, a technomancer can issue a command to a robot within 30 feet as a standard action once per day. The command must be in a language the robot can understand. The robot can resist the effects of this ability by succeeding at a Will saving throw against a DC of 10 + 1/2 the technomancer's class level + the technomancer's Charisma or Intelligence modifier (whichever is higher). At 7th level, a technomancer can use this ability twice per day, and at 9th level he can use it three times per day. This ability otherwise functions as <i>suggestion</i>, save that it is not mind-affecting and can only affect constructs with the robot subtype.</p>",
