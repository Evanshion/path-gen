Each hour of crafting when using his recycle technology ability is equivalent to 8 hours of uninterrupted crafting; he can perform up to 8 hours of such amazingly efficient work per day. Any item he completes is treated as reconditioned for the remainder of that day. It can be added permanently to his group of reconditioned items if he has an available slot or stops maintaining one of his current reconditioned items. </p>",
