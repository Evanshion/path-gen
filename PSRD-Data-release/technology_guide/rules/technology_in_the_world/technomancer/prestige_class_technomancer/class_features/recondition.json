    "body": "<p id=\"recondition\"> Through constant maintenance, a technomancer can keep a single piece of still-functioning timeworn technology in good working order. Reconditioning a timeworn technological item takes 8 hours, after which the item no longer has a chance of glitching when used by the technomancer and can be recharged normally by the technomancer but no one else. Keeping the item working requires 1 hour of maintenance each day (this can overlap with the time needed to prepare spells), or the item reverts to a normal piece of timeworn technology and must be reconditioned again. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a technomancer can keep an additional item in good working order, without increasing his daily maintenance time.</p>",
