    "body": "<p id=\"study-technology\">At 3rd level, a technomancer can study a robot, technological object, or technological trap within 30 feet as a move action and attempt a Knowledge (engineering) check to identify it. If he succeeds, he gains a competence bonus equal to 1/2 his level on attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, saving throws, and skill checks involving the studied creature, object, or trap, as well as a dodge bonus of the same amount against attacks from the subject of his study. This bonus lasts a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). If he studies a new subject, he loses his bonus against the previous subject.</p>",
