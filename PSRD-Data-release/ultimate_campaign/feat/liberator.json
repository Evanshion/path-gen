In addition, as a standard action you can inspire slaves and former slaves within 120 feet, giving them temporary hit points equal to 1/2 your character level and a +1 bonus on saving throws. These benefits last for 1 hour, and a given creature can receive this benefit only once per day. These are mind-affecting effects, and the inspiring bonus is language-dependent.</p>",
