Though hardly private, this space typically includes beds or cots, linens, small chests with poor locks, and chamber pots. If this room is part of an Inn, the building is more of a flophouse or hostel than a traveler's hotel, which would have private rooms. If part of a Hospital, this room houses patients.</p>",
