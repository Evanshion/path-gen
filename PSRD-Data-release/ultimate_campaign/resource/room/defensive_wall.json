    "body": "<p>This simple wooden wall, fence, or hedge surrounds your structure and provides a modicum of security. It is no taller than 10 feet, includes a single gate with a simple lock, and can be scaled with a DC 14 Climb check. It can be constructed as a stone wall&mdash;increasing the height by up to 10 feet and the Climb DC to 20&mdash;by doubling the price. If combined with a Guard Post, this can be a walkable wall with a parapet.</p>",
