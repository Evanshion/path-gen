    "body": "<p>A Magical Repository is similar to a Book Repository, but specific to the study of the arcane arts. It contains shelves of books, comfortable chairs, and tables for studying and for scribing notes and scrolls. If you construct this room from scratch, it grants someone who studies there for 1 hour a +3 bonus on a Knowledge (arcana) check to answer a question. If you upgrade a Book Repository into this room, you either keep the original Book Repository's bonus on Knowledge checks or change its skill to Knowledge (arcana). An hour of study in this room also grants a +3 bonus on Spellcraft checks. The room grants an additional +1 bonus on Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks for spell research (see Research a Spell on page 86) and crafting magic items.</p>",
