    "body": "<p>A Reliquary is built to securely store religious artifacts, and dedicated to a specific deity or philosophy. It contains shelves to house the items, special display cases to protect them, and sometimes chairs and tables to allow study. It's secured by a strong wooden door or grating with a good lock. Unlike a Vault, a Reliquary is intended to allow people to observe its contents. When stocked with relics appropriate to the chosen deity or philosophy, the room grants a +1 bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks relating to the history, powers, and purpose of those relics.</p>",
