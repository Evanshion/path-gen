    "body": "<p>This is either a room or a passage connecting two rooms in the building. The access to this space is controlled by a secret a (DC 20). A passage can have secret doors at both ends or a normal door at one end and a secret door at the other. If it's a room, it is typically used to hide someone or something you don't want discovered. If it's a passage, it's typically used for clandestine travel within the building, often for the purpose of smuggling or spying. For every 500 extra gp you spend, you can improve one secret door in the building to a well-hidden secret door (DC 30).</p>",
