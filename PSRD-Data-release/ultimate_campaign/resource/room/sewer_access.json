    "body": "<p>A Sewer Access might be a tunnel or room, or something as simple as a sturdy trap door in the floor. Constructing it requires a settlement with a sewer or septic system, and connects some part of the building to that system. You can use this as an Escape Route, but only to get to and from the sewer. The door to the sewer is a strong wooden door with a good lock. For an additional 500 gp, it has an iron door instead. If you have a Lavatory and Sewer Access, you may automatically connect the Lavatory to the sewer with indoor plumbing.</p>",
