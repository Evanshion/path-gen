He might fear chaos and disorder, and perhaps have good reason to do so from past experience. A lawful neutral person is not as concerned about who rules him so much as how secure he and his compatriots are, and finds great solace in the normality of society. Such a character may admire the strongest of leaders and punishments if they keep order, and he may support wars against other nations even if his own country is a brutal invader&mdash;his only concern is the rightness of the military action.</p><p>A lawful neutral character who follows his own code never breaks it willingly, and may become a martyr to defend it.</p>",
