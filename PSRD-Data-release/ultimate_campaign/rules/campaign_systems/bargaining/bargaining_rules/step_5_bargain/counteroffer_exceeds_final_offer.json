    "body": "<p>If the seller counters with a price higher than the buyer's Final Offer, have the seller attempt a Diplomacy check (25 + the buyer's Charisma modifier). Success means the buyer counteroffers at a price between the Initial Offer and the Final Offer. Failure means the buyer holds at her Initial Offer. Failure by 5 or more means the buyer is insulted and lowers her offer or refuses to deal with the seller. The seller can try again, but the Diplomacy DC increases by 5 unless the seller lowers his price.</p>",
