    "body": "<p>An unscrupulous character may use magic to charm or dupe buyers into accepting inflated prices. Something as simple as <i>charm person</i> can alter the Diplomacy and Sense Motive DCs by 5 in the spellcaster's favor for an entire negotiation, and a specific <i>suggestion</i> can alter the result on a single roll by 10 in the caster's favor. If the buyer later realizes that magic influenced the negotiation, she may refuse to deal with the spellcaster and attempt to get her money back, or at least report the spellcaster to the local authorities.</p>",
