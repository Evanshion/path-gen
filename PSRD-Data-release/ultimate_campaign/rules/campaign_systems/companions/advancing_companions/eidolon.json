    "body": "<p>Compared to an animal companion or cohort, an eidolon is a unique type of companion&mdash;it is intelligent and loyal to you, and you have absolute power over whether it is present in the material world or banished to its home plane. You literally have the power to reshape the eidolon's body using the <i>transmogrify</i> spell, and though technically the eidolon can resist this&mdash;the Saving Throw is \"Will negates (harmless)\"&mdash;it is assumed that the eidolon complies with what you want. After all, the eidolon can't actually be killed while summoned; at worst, it might experience pain before damage sends it back to its home plane. This means the eidolon is usually willing to take great risks to help you. If swimming through acid was the only way to save you, it would do so, knowing that it won't die and will recover. The eidolon is a subservient creature whose very nature depends upon your will, so you decide what feats, skill points, ability score increases, and evolutions the eidolon gains as it advances.</p>",
