If the GM is running a kingdom-building campaign where hireling NPCs are heavily involved, you might suggest ways for NPCs to advance, but the final decision is up to the GM. If you want more control over your hireling's feats, skills, and class levels, you should select that hireling as a follower with the Leadership feat.</p>",
