    "body": "<p><i>Charm person</i>, <i>dominate person</i>, and similar effects turn an NPC into a companion for a limited time. Most charm-like effects make the target friendly to you&mdash;the target has to follow your requests only if they're reasonable, and has its own ideas about what is reasonable. For example, few creatures consider \"hand over all your valuables\" or \"let me put these manacles on you\" a reasonable request from a friend. You might have to use Diplomacy or Intimidate checks to influence a charmed ally, and the GM has the final say as to what happens. Though the target of a charm effect considers you a friend, it probably feels indifferent at best toward the other PCs and won't listen to requests from them. A creature under a dominate effect is more of a puppet, and you can force it to do anything that isn't suicidal or otherwise against its well-being. Treat it as player-controlled, with the GM making its saving throws to resist inappropriate commands.</p>",
