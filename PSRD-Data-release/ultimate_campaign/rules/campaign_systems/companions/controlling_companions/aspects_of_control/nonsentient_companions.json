    "body": "<p>A nonsentient companion (one with animal-level intelligence) is loyal to you in the way a well-trained dog is&mdash;the creature is conditioned to obey your commands, but its behavior is limited by its intelligence and it can't make altruistic moral decisions&mdash;such as nobly sacrificing itself to save another. Animal companions, cavalier mounts, and purchased creatures (such as common horses and guard dogs) fall into this category. In general they're GM-controlled companions. You can direct them using the Handle Animal skill, but their specific behavior is up to the GM.</p>",
