    "body": "<p>When the players ask what they find while exploring a hex, the answer should never be \"nothing.\" Even in the simplest field of wheat, offer a bit of detail&mdash;something compelling to help flesh out the world. The foundation of a long-forgotten village or a set of standing stones built to honor a lost god can be hints about that area's history. The Things Found on the Roadside (<i>GameMastery Guide</i> 224) and Table 7&mdash;58: Scenic Spots (<i>GameMastery Guide</i> 225) list many examples of interesting features you can use to fill in details.</p><p>Other than in the rare village, exploring PCs have very few opportunities to resupply. Acquiring food and finding shelter against the elements is paramount, and losing supplies has a crippling effect on the party, as they have to hunt and forage just to acquire enough food and water to survive another day. An exploration encounter can be driven by complications like these, where every meal foraged is a victory in itself.</p><p>Remember that adventuring is more about glory than grim survival, so it's best to keep a balance between realistic exploration issues (such as obtaining fresh food and water) and fun, exciting monster encounters. If you make exploration both dangerous and rewarding, the players will remain eager to keep striking out into the great unknown.</p>",
