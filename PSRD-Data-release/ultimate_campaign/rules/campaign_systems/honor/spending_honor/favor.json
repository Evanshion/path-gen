Examples include access to private resources (such as a wizard's library), unhindered passage through enemy territory (such as getting an official to write you a letter of passage), or an audience with an important person (such as a high priest or city governor). <i>Cost</i>: 1d6 to 5d6 honor points, depending on the difficulty of the favor and the NPC's attitude toward you. If the GM is using the Contacts rules, the typical cost is 1d6 honor points per risk level of the task.</p>",
