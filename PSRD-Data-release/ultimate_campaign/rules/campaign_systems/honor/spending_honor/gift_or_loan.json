    "body": "<p>You ask an NPC ally to give or loan you something of value. The gift or loan must be in the form of wealth or a single item. The GM may rule that an NPC refuses to give away a particularly rare or expensive item. The item must be something the NPC can actually grant&mdash;you can't ask a peasant for a suit of armor or a ronin for the emperor's personal sword. A gift is permanent, but a loan lasts only for the game session in which it is granted. <i>Cost</i>: 1d6 honor points per 2,000 gp value of the gift. If the request is a loan instead of a gift, the honor point cost is halved, but if you do not return the item at the end of the session, you must pay this honor point cost at the start of each session until the item is returned. This counts as your one opportunity to spend honor points that session; you can't spend honor on anything else until you return the item.</p>",
