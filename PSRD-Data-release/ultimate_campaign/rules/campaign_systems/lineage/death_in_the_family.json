    "body": "<p>When a GM kills your PC's family members, it carries just as much risk as using your PC's family members as villains, and yields far fewer benefits. The death of a loved one at an enemy's hand can certainly provide an emotional kick to the campaign, and help characterize a villain as a truly loathsome individual. However, the unforeseen death of a beloved family member can just as easily prove jarring or traumatic if you are heavily invested in your character's family's well-being. If the GM believes it is necessary to place your character's family in peril, you should have a fair opportunity to defend or save them, or at least to distract the one responsible long enough for your family to get to safety.</p>",
