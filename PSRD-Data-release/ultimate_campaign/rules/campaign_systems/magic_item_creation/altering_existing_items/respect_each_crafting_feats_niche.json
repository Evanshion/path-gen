    "body": "<p>You might be tempted to create rings that have charges like wands, or bracers with multiple charge-based effects like staves. A GM allowing this makes Craft Wondrous Item and Forge Ring even more versatile and powerful, and devalues Craft Staff and Craft Wand because those two feats can create only charged items.</p><p>Before allowing such an item, consider whether the reverse idea would be appropriate&mdash;if someone with Craft Wand can't make a <i>wand of protection +1</i> that grants a deflection bonus like a <i>ring of protection +1</i>, and if someone with Craft Staff can't make a <i>handy haverstaff</i> that stores items like a <i>handy haversack</i>, then Craft Wondrous Item and Forge Ring shouldn't be able to poach item types from the other feats.</p><p>GMs who wish to allow some of these sorts of alterations should consider using the original item as a talismanic component for the final item (see page 173).</p>",
