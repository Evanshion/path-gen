In particular, the magic belts and circlets that give enhancement bonuses to ability scores are in this category&mdash;characters who want to enhance multiple physical or mental ability scores must pay extra for combination items like a <i>belt of physical might</i> or <i>headband of mental prowess</i>.</p><p>If there is a trend of all <i>Core Rulebook</i> items of a particular type using a particular slot (such as items that grant physical ability score bonuses being belts or items that grant movement bonuses being boots), GMs should be hesitant to allow you to move those abilities to other slots; otherwise, they ignore these deliberate restrictions by cheaply spreading out these items over unused slots.</p>",
