    "body": "<p>For younger characters, parents might represent an authority of some kind, with power to bring them back home or to any other place where the parent needs some kind of service or duty performed. For older characters, parents can represent the need to repay all the debts and kindnesses of being reared. Some adventure hooks include:</p><ul><li>Your father calls you back home from the frivolity of adventuring to mind the family lands or to take over for the family business.</li><li>Your retired adventurer mother asks you to settle one last quest that she failed to complete.</li><li>Your elderly grandfather is facing death (whether from a curse, disease, or natural causes), spurring you to quest for a cure or locate lore on extending life. This may be an altruistic choice or to spare you the burden of inheriting his responsibilities.</li></ul>",
