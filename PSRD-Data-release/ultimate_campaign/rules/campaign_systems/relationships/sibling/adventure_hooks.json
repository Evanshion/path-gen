Some adventure hooks include:</p><ul><li>Your brother is considering arranged marriages from several influential families. He asks you to investigate them to find which bride might be both a worthy match for the family and a good spouse for him.</li><li>Your sister signed on to a dangerous expedition to harness rare material spell components and hasn't returned. It is your duty to find her&mdash;and if she is dead, complete her contracted service.</li><li>Your brother has finally decided to impress your parents and asks for your help in tracking down and slaying a powerful monster in order to restore the family fortune. He won't survive if he goes on his own.</li><li>Your foolhardy younger siblings were swindled into buying barren land with a monster-infested mine on it. They are now trapped and you must intervene before they are killed.</li><li>Your long-lost sibling returns at the same time that a rash of mysterious crimes occurs. Your sibling could be responsible for the crimes or have information about their true cause.</li></ul>",
