    "body": "<p>In any settlement of at least 5,000 inhabitants, you may locate a corrupt official. If you're imprisoned or fined for crimes committed in the settlement's jurisdiction, you may take advantage of this contact. You pay no fines and escape sentencing if you can make a Diplomacy check (DC 15 for petty crimes, 20 for serious crimes, or 25 for capital crimes). You can use this ability once per game session. You may select this title once for each settlement in your Sphere of Influence; each time you select it, choose one settlement where you may use the award.</p>",
