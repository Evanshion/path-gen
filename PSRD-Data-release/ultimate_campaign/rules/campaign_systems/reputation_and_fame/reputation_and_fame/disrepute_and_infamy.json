    "body": "<p>If your Fame drops below 0, your reputation is based on infamy rather than fame. Treat your Fame as a positive number instead of a negative number for all rules relating to Fame, Sphere of Influence, and Prestige Points (for example, a villainous Fame of &mdash;20 is equivalent to a heroic Fame of 20 for the purpose of determining what awards you can buy).</p><p>If an event would increase your Fame, you may choose to increase your Fame (bringing it closer to 0) or decrease your Fame (making it a larger negative number). For example, if your Fame is &mdash;20 and you publicly roll a 30 on a Craft check to create a masterwork sword (normally worth +2), you may increase your Fame to &mdash;18 or decrease it to &mdash;22. Negative events that decrease your Fame always count as negative (a villain attacking innocent people doesn't make the public like him more).</p><p>If you have a negative Fame, nonevil NPCs often have unfriendly or hostile reactions to you (see Table 3&mdash;7: Negative Fame Reactions). Note that if you have a reputation for being powerful and dangerous, NPCs might avoid you rather than confront you.<span class=\"char-style-override-87\"></span></p>",
