    "body": "<p>You begin play with a Fame equal to your character level + your Charisma modifier. Your Fame ranges from &mdash;100 to 100, with 0 representing a lack of any notoriety. Through the course of the campaign, your words and deeds help you build a reputation. Though an adventurer performs many deeds, not all are significant enough to warrant a change in Fame. If possible, the GM should stick to those deeds that directly affect the story or campaign and not reward points for minor victories. The significance of specific deeds should generally be left up to the GM, though Table 3&mdash;5 details some specific examples. If your Fame ever drops below 0, see Disrepute and Infamy on page 184.</p>",
