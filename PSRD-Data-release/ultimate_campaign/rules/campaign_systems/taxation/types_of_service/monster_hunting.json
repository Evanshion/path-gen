    "body": "<p>Few things better suit adventurers than being sent out to kill menacing beasts and monsters. Unfortunately, collectors often lack judgment as to what sort of opponents lie within a party's grasp. Novice adventurers aren't likely to be sent chasing dragons, but great heroes might be sent to dispatch a \"demon pig\" that turns out to be a mere dire boar, or mid-level ones sent to handle a \"wandering giant\" that turns out to be a storm giant or titan. Fleeing such conflicts may have long-lasting repercussions.</p>",
