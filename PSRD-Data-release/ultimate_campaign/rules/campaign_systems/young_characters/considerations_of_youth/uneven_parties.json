    "body": "<p>NPC classes are not as powerful as PC classes. Therefore, if some players have young characters and others have adult characters, the adults in the group will be more powerful and have other advantages. Even if you are fine with playing an underpowered character, the other players in the group might not be okay with a weaker character tagging along, especially if your character's relative weakness potentially jeopardizes the group. Before you create a young character, make sure that all players are willing to accept a young character into the party.</p>",
