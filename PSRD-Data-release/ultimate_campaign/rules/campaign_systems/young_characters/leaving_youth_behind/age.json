    "body": "<p>The simplest way for a young character to reach adulthood is by aging into new age thresholds. This table includes the age when members of the core races reach adulthood. Once a character reaches that age, she loses the ability score adjustments related to youth and may retrain NPC classes. If you aren't playing one of the races from the <i>Core Rulebook</i>, find a race with the lifespan that most closely approximates that of your character's race and work with your GM to create reasonable age benchmarks for youth, adulthood, middle age, and beyond.</p>",
