The conflict and your motivation are each worth a number of CP; you can adjust the number of CP based on the resolution of the conflict. When you determine the total CP, you then must add your CP on one alignment track or distribute the points on both of them&mdash;the good-evil track and the lawful-chaotic track, as detailed on the Determining Alignment table. Position 1 on the track represents the first CP added. Each point on the first track represents you turning away from what is good and heading down a path of evil. Each point on the second track represents a disregard for law as you grow more chaotic. This determines how the conflict ultimately affected your alignment and to what extent. If you are using the rules for changing your alignment, this also determines your starting place on the alignment track. If you start with 0 CP on either track, assume you start at 1 on the track for those rules.</p>",
