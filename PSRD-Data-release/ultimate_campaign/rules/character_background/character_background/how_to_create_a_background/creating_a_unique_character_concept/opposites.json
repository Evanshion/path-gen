For instance, if you're playing the aforementioned dwarven fighter, perhaps one of the following holds:</p><ul><li>You have taken a vow against drinking, can't hold your liquor, or act in a peculiar, eccentric way when drunk.</li><li>You can't grow a beard.</li><li>You favor a weapon that is not a hammer, axe, crossbow, or other typical dwarven weapon.</li><li>You live in a forest or on an island rather than in the hills and mountains favored by most dwarves.</li><li>You are a pacifist who loathes violence.</li><li>You deeply pity or love orcs and goblins.</li></ul><p>Any one of these character quirks can prove ripe for character development and story hooks in the campaign.</p>",
