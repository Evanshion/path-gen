Yet, while original <i>ideas </i>are hard to come by, every <i>person</i> you meet is unique, shaped by his or her individual experiences. Rather than strive for an original concept, try focusing on the experiences that define your character's life and give him his personality and point of view. Specific experiences will help move you away from the stereotypical and cliche.</p>",
