    "body": "<p>Suppose you want to create a network of thieves and spies in town. You need eyes and ears on the street, so you should include a Cutpurse team. You want people to be able to break into homes and steal valuables, so you should include a Robber team. To hide your wealth from the tax collector, you need a Bureaucrat team. By adding up all the Goods, Influence, Labor, and Magic values in the Create and Time entries of the rooms' stat blocks, you get a total of 3 points of Goods, 11 points of Influence, 6 points of Labor, and 6 days. If you spend that capital, after 6 days of recruiting, your guild is ready to work.</p><p>Alternatively, if you wanted to just purchase an existing guild, with the GM's approval you can add up the gp prices for those teams and pay that amount to the current guildmaster. For the Thieves' Guild described above, the total price is 510 gp.</p>",
