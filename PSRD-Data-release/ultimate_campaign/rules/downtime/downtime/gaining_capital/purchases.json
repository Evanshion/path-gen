Although you can't sell capital, you can use it for its listed Purchased Cost as payment toward any applicable downtime activity that requires you to spend gp. For example, if you are brewing a potion, you can spend 1 point of Magic toward the cost of the materials needed to make the potion as if that point were equal to 100 gp.</p><p>Although you may have a lot of gp or other capital to throw around in a settlement, the settlement's size limits how much you can accomplish per day.</p>",
