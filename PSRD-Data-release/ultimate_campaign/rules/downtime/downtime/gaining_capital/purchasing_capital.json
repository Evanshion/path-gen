    "body": "<p>The easiest way to gain capital is to purchase it by buying materials, bribing people, paying administrative fees, hiring workers, and so on. Goods, Influence, Labor, and Magic each have a specific gp value for this method, listed in the Purchased Cost column of the table below. If you need one of these types of capital, you can spend gp to get it, just like buying a <i>+1 sword</i> or hiring a spellcaster to cast <i>remove curse</i> costs you gp. For example, Goods have a Purchased Cost of 20 gp each; if you need to spend 5 points of Goods to repair your tavern, you can spend 100 gp (5 \u00d7 20 gp) to purchase the necessary Goods. Purchasing capital is fast, but expensive.</p>",
