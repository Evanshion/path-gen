You construct a building out of component rooms that allow you to configure the building exactly how you want it (see Rooms and Teams).</p><p>How much capital you can spend per day is limited by the size of the settlement you're in. Once you've spent the total capital and time needed to finish your building, it's complete and you can use it immediately.</p>",
