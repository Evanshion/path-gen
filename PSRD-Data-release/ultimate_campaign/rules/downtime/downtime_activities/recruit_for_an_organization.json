For example, you could may want to recruit employees (or minions) if you're a rogue and want to start your own gang of cutpurses or a cleric who wants to start a cult of followers. You create an organization out of component teams, so you can configure the organization exactly how you want it (see Rooms and Teams). How much downtime capital you can spend in a day is limited by the size of the settlement you're in (see Spending Limits). When you've spent the appropriate capital and time for your organization, it's complete and you can put it to work immediately.</p>",
