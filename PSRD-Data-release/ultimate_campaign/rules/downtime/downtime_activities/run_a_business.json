This counts as using downtime to earn capital (see Gaining Capital), but you gain a +10 bonus on your check.</p><p>The capital you generate must be a kind that your building can generate. For example, an inn that generates gp and Influence can generate only those two currencies using this downtime activity; you can't use it to generate Goods, Labor, or Magic just because you're personally running it for the day. You must earn capital acquired in this way as normal.</p>",
