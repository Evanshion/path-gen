For simplicity's sake, interacting with the animal for an hour per day in a safe environment counts toward this training and doesn't require you to spend any downtime. As long as you maintain this daily contact, you need to succeed at only one Handle Animal check at the end of the rearing period. An interruption requires you to succeed at a check to continue the rearing (you may attempt this check once per day). The assumption is that you have a non-expert taking care of the animal's basic needs while you are away so it isn't neglected. If you know you will miss a day of this contact, you may spend 1 point of Influence or 1 point of Labor for each missed day to have a skilled animal handler rear the animal for the day, meaning your absence doesn't count as an interruption in the animal's training.</p>",
