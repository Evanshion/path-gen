    "body": "<p>The following events are examples of the sort of random encounters a GM can add to the downtime system. Rolling for events occurs during the Event phase.</p><p>The first set of events consists of events that could happen to any kind of building&mdash;bad weather, a fire, a famous visitor, and so on. Following those generic events are specific events keyed to certain types of buildings&mdash;an Inn has different events than a Military Academy or Smithy. This section concludes with events for several kinds of organizations. Not every building and organization has its own event table&mdash;the GM should use the Generic Building Events table or take inspiration from this section to make tables for other buildings and organizations.</p><p>If you don't own any buildings or organizations in a settlement, the GM can use these event tables to create events for buildings you are in or near. For example, the GM can use the Tavern Events table to generate an event while you are at a tavern. The event descriptions assume that you are the owner, so the GM should adjust the outcome if you are merely present for an event.</p><p>These tables are designed so low rolls tend to be beneficial and high rolls are harmful or dangerous. If you're using the settlement danger value, add the danger value to the percentile roll. Some results have you roll on another event table. Reroll any results that don't make sense.</p><p>Many events allow a skill check to affect the outcome of the event. If you're present, either attempt this skill check yourself or ask another member of the party or a manager to attempt the check for you. If you're absent, either your representative (such as a cohort or manager) attempts the check or roll 1d20 with no bonuses to determine the result. The GM can also allow methods other than those listed to end harmful events. For example, you might be able to end an ongoing rivalry event by befriending the owner of the rival business or driving him out of town.</p>",
