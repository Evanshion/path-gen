You lose 1d2 points of Goods to the rookie's mess. Taking the servant under your wing results in an additional loss of 1d2 points of Goods per day for 1d3 days (due to breakage and other mishaps), but earns you 1 point of Influence and 1d6 points of Labor at the end of the training period. If you fire the incompetent underling, you gain 1d6 points of Influence as word of your iron-fisted management spreads.</p>",
