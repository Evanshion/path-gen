While the curse persists (whether it is real or imagined), the building's generated currency is reduced by half, but any day that it generates at least 3 points of Influence there is a 25% chance that it also generates 1 point of Magic. You may end this event by spending 2 points of Influence and 1 of Magic, or by casting <i>bless</i>, <i>break enchantment</i>, or <i>remove curse</i> on the room.</p>",
