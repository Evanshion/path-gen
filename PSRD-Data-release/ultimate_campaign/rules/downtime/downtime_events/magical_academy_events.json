The bitter student is adept at hiding out&mdash;he could be anyone! Until you expose the bitter student, each time you'd roll an event for this building, you must roll twice, and the GM chooses the worse of the two results. When you roll this event, immediately roll twice on the Generic Building Events table , and the GM chooses which of the two possible events occurs. You can try to find and expose the student once per day by attempting a DC 30 Perception check. The DC lowers by 1 for each prior failure as you get closer to identifying the culprit. The bitter student is exposed automatically if you reroll this event as either of your two rolls.</p>",

At the end of each combat round the monster remains alive, its rampage deals damage to the building, costing 1 point of Goods, Magic, or Labor (chosen randomly each time).</p>",
