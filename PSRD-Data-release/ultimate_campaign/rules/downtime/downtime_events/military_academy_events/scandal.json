    "body": "<p>Some sort of scandal strikes your academy&mdash;an affair between a teacher and a student, a destructive prank or dangerous hazing, a student brawling with a noble's son, or the like. The scandal's repercussions last 2d4 days. During that period, it's difficult for anyone at the academy to concentrate, the building takes a &mdash;5 penalty on checks to generate capital, and you lose 1d2 points of Influence each day. Once per day, you can attempt to repair the damage to your reputation and end the event with a successful DC 20 Bluff or Diplomacy check. Failure extends the duration of the scandal's fallout by another 1d4 days.</p>",
