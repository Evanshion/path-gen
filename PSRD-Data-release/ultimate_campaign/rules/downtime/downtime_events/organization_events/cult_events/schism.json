Attempt a Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Knowledge (religion) check against a DC equal to 20 + the number of teams in the organization. If you succeed, treat this as an apostate event as described above. If you fail by less than 5, you lose 1d2 points of Influence and 1d2 points of Labor. If you fail by 5 or more, you lose one team for every 5 full points by which you failed the DC. These lost teams go with the apostate.</p>",
