You may handle this as a combat encounter or attempt a DC 25 Bluff, Intimidate, or Profession (soldier) check. If you succeed, the instigator leaves and you lose 1 point of Labor but gain 1d2 points of Influence. If you fail, you lose control of the Mercenary Company as if from business attrition.</p>",
