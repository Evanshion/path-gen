If you succeed, the guild gains a +20 bonus on its next check to generate capital and you gain 1d4 points of Influence. If you fail, the guild automatically rolls a 1 on all checks to generate capital for 1 day, and you lose 1 point of Influence. If you fail by 10 or more, there's a 25% chance that a team involved in the heist is captured (treat this as the entrapment event).</p>",
