    "body": "<p>A famous hero, noble, military commander, or similar notable comes to your Smithy with a special request for an unusual or masterwork item&mdash;perhaps manacles, a cage, exotic barding, or a replacement piece for an iron golem. For 1d4 days, as payments come in for the request, your building gains a +20 bonus on its first check to generate capital each day. At the end of this period, attempt a DC 30 Craft check of the appropriate type. On a success, your Smithy has done so well on the request that the customer spreads the word of your skill and you gain 1d6 points of Influence.</p>",
