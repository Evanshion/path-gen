Since you can't be open to the public, the building generates no capital that day. The troupe remains for 1d4 days, and on those days you gain a +20 bonus on the building's first check to generate capital each day. If the troupe is present when an event at the Theater makes you lose Labor, the troupe leaves early.</p>",
