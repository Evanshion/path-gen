    "body": "<p>If the settlement's nature is contrary to the kind of building or organization you're trying to construct or create (such as a Black Market or Thieves' Guild in a settlement with low Crime and high Law settlement modifiers), the GM might decide that construction or recruitment takes 1d6 \u00d7 10% longer than normal (minimum 1 extra day) if you aren't monitoring the work.</p><p>You can shorten this extra time before or during the delay by spending 1 point of Influence, which reduces the additional time by 1d6 days (minimum 0 days of delay). You can instead have a cohort monitor the work, or hire a competent employee (see page 88) to do so; either of these options completely prevents the delay.</p>",
