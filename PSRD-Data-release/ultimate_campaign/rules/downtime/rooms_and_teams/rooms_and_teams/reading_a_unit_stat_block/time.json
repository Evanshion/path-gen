    "body": "<p>This entry indicates how long it takes to complete the room or recruit the team. You may divide the Time price for a room by 2, 3, or 4 by spending 2, 3, or 4 times its Labor price. You may divide the Time price for a team by 2, 3, or 4 by spending 2, 3, or 4 times its Influence price. You must be in the settlement at the start of the construction or recruitment period, but don't have to spend any of your downtime days to begin construction or recruitment. In effect, you have to be present only to give the order to begin.</p><p>If a team doesn't have a Time price, spending capital to recruit that team doesn't count as a downtime action.</p><p>Note that the Time prices for teams are for recruiting the team for long-term employment and don't reflect the availability of these kinds of NPCs for temporary work. For example, if you need to hire a 3rd-level cleric to cast <i>lesser restoration</i>, you don't have to spend 7 days of downtime recruiting a Priest team&mdash;you can just make standard spellcasting arrangements as described in the <i>Core Rulebook</i>.</p>",
