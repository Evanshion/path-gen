Alternatively, you may construct a hidden space that allows you to watch another room without being observed, such as through a peephole in a tapestry or mosaic. One side of this room provides a +4 bonus on Stealth checks to hide from creatures in the adjoining room. A Confessional can be constructed in a way that allows this bonus to apply to creatures in both sides or just in one.</p>",
