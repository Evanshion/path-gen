    "body": "<p>A Hatchery is used for nesting and hatching egg-laying creatures such as birds, lizards, owlbears, or dragons. Alternatively, it can be used for fish, shellfish, or other aquatic egg-laying creatures. This room might be on the roof to allow flying creatures to come and go, or might be connected to the building on ground level. It contains cages and soft bedding to cradle the eggs, and might contain a small wood-burning stove to keep the eggs warm if parent animals aren't available.</p>",
