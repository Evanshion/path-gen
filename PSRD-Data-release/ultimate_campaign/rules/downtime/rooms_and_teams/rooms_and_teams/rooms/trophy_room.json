    "body": "<p>This is a place to hang trophies from your adventures, such as stuffed monster heads, rare paintings, strange statues, and old magic items you don't need any more. Because of the display cases and clutter, this room isn't much good for anything else, though it might include chairs or benches to allow people to sit while they admire your treasures. If you want to use your trophies to decorate another room instead of placing them in their own room, construct the Furnishings augmentation instead. A Museum makes money by charging visitors or sponsors to view items like these.</p>",
