    "body": "<p>Like a PC, your kingdom has an alignment, which you decide when you form the kingdom. The kingdom's alignment represents the majority outlook and behavior of the people within that kingdom when they're considered as a group. (Individual citizens and even some leaders may be of different alignments.) When you decide on your kingdom's alignment, apply the following adjustments to the kingdom's statistics: <i>Chaotic</i>: +2 Loyalty; <i>Evil</i>: +2 Economy; <i>Good</i>: +2 Loyalty; <i>Lawful</i>: +2 Economy; <i>Neutral</i>: Stability +2 (apply this twice if the kingdom's alignment is simply Neutral, not Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Neutral). A kingdom's alignment rarely changes, though at the GM's option, it can shift through the actions of its rulers or its people.</p>",
