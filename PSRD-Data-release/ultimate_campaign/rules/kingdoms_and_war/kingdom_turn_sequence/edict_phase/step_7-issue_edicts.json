The leaders don't want to spend BP and increase Size right now, so in Step 2 they don't claim any hexes. In Step 3, the leaders construct a Farm in one of the kingdom's prepared hexes (Consumption &mdash;2, Treasury &mdash;2 BP). In Steps 5 and 6, the leaders continue to be frugal and do not construct settlement improvements or create armies. In Step 7, the leaders issue a Holiday edict of one national holiday (Loyalty +1, Consumption +1) and set the Promotion edict level to \"none\" (Stability &mdash;1, Consumption +0). Looking ahead to the Income phase, Jessica realizes that an average roll for her Economy check would be a failure (10 on the 1d20 + 52 Economy &mdash; 4 Unrest = 58, less than the Control DC of 60), which means there's a good chance the kingdom won't generate any BP this turn. She decides to set the Taxation edict to \"heavy\" (Economy +3, Loyalty &mdash;4). At the end of this phase, the kingdom has Economy 55, Loyalty 42, Stability 55, Unrest 4, Consumption 4, and Treasury 5 BP.</p>",
