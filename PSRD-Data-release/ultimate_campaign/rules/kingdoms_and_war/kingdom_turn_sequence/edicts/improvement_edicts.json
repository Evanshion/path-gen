Your kingdom's Size limits how many improvements you can make each turn; see the Improvement Edicts table below. You can make all of the improvements listed on the appropriate row of the table. For example, if your kingdom's Size is 5, on each turn you can create 1 new settlement, 1 new building, 2 terrain improvements, and claim 1 more hex.</p>",
