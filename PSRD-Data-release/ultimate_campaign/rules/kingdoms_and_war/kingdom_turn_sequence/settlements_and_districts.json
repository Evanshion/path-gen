    "body": "<p>The greatest assets of your kingdom are its settlements. Most settlements start as simple villages, and some grow over time into bustling cities.</p><p>The District Grid is divided into 9 large blocks separated by streets. Each block consists of 4 smaller lots separated by alleys. Treat each lot as approximately 750 feet per side, so overall the district takes up about 1 square mile. On each lot you may construct a building, and each building affects your kingdom's Economy, Loyalty, and so on.</p><p>Most settlements only have 1 district. If your District Grid is full and you want to add another district (for example, if you run out of available lots in that settlement and want to construct additional buildings), you can create an additional district for that settlement by paying the preparation cost for the settlement's terrain as listed on Table Terrain and Terrain Improvements. Remember that your kingdom's Control DC is based on the number of districts in your settlement.</p><p>The placement of buildings in your district is up to you&mdash;you can start in the center of the district and build outward, or start at the edge and build toward the center. Some buildings (such as the Guildhall) take up more than 1 lot on the grid. You can't divide up these larger structures, though you can place them so they cover a street. (Streets do not count as lots.)</p>",
