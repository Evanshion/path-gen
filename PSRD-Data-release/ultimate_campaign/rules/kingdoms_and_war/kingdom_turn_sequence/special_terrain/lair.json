    "body": "<p>A Lair is usually a cave or defensible shelter that can be used as a defensive fallback point, a storage location, or even a guardpost or prison. If you claim a hex with a Lair, Stability increases by 1. If you construct a Fort or Watchtower over a Lair, its Defense increases by 1. At the GM's option, a Lair may allow access to an underground cavern hex (see the Terrain and Terrain Improvements table).</p>",
