The army hit point rules are abstract and represent wounded units, incapacitated units, and dead units. For an army with a very low hit point total, the number of active units in the army can even be equal to or fewer than those of an army of a smaller size. For example, a Large army normally has 200 units, but if that army is very wounded, it could have only 100 or fewer units able to fight&mdash;the same number as a Medium army. Because an army's Consumption is based on its ACR (which is based on its size), you might be able to reduce your Consumption costs if you reform an army into a smaller size.</p><p>At any time outside of combat, you can reform a wounded army (at half hit points or fewer) into an army one size smaller with full hit points.

The GM can allow players to recruit some of these armies, or might reserve most of them as unusual foes for mass battles. None of these armies has a starting Morale listed, because starting Morale starts at 0, modified by the commander.</p><p>Most of these armies are Medium, showing a player or GM what tactics, resources, and special abilities a typical army of that type has, yet still keeping it easy to scale the army to a larger or smaller size. If an army has a resource, the listed Consumption is for an army of the listed size; if you change the size of the army, remember to subtract the Consumption cost for its original size, scale that cost to the new size, then add the scaled cost to the army's base Consumption cost. If the army lists an additional cost for recruiting the army, this recruitment cost scales in the same way.</p><p>The special abilities listed for monster armies are approximations to model the unit monster's special abilities. For example, an individual troglodyte's stench nauseates opponents, but there is no army special ability that does that, so the troglodyte army has paralysis instead, which has a comparable effect. Likewise, the astral deva army has the alchemy ability, which is a reasonable approximation of an individual astral deva's ability to use <i>heal</i> once per day; the one-unit army doesn't actually carry alchemist extracts.</p><p>If a special ability provides a constant bonus (such as the bonus from charge or pounce), that bonus is automatically included in the army's stat block. If the bonus is conditional (like the DV bonus from rock catching or the ranged damage bonus from rock throwing), you need to account for that bonus when the conditions are right.</p><p>Some armies have custom bonuses built into their DV or OM. This represents the unit's special defenses (such as damage reduction) and high damage output against single targets, which should affect an opposing army in a greater way than the standard monster-to-army conversion rules would indicate. Determining army stat block values for small numbers of powerful monsters is more of an art than a science.</p>",

Instead of making 100 attack rolls for each side of a battle between elves and orcs, you treat the elf army as one unit and the orc army as another unit, and they battle each other with just one roll each. Instead of the armies taking turns attacking each other, they roll simultaneously. Smaller armies have fewer individual creatures (units), larger armies have more units, and the number of units directly relates to how dangerous an army is.</p><p>Every army has a commander, typically a seasoned veteran, who directs the army's actions. You can lead an army yourself, making you its commander and providing bonuses depending on your kingdom leadership role.</p><p>Armies can learn different tactics, such as using reserve archers, forming a defensive wall, or using dirty tricks. An army can use strategies like attacking recklessly and aggressively (much like a creature using the Power Attack feat) or being cautious and defensive (like using Combat Expertise). The army's commander decides the tactics and strategy used in battle.</p><p>Conditions on the battlefield affect the process and outcome of the battle. For example, muddy terrain slows walking armies but has no effect on flying armies; night combat hinders human armies but not orc armies.</p><p>Resolving the battle consists of three phases in which the commanders decide on tactics, the armies make ranged attacks (if any), and the armies then close to melee range. They then remain in melee until one side flees or is destroyed.</p><p>The following summarizes the key rolls you'll make when using mass combat:</p>",
