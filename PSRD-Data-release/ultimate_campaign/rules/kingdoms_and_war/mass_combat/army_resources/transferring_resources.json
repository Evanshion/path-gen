    "body": "<p>You may take a purchased resource from one army and give it to an army of equal or smaller size so long as the creatures in the recipient armies can use the resource (for example, improved weapons for a hill giant army are of little use to an army of human zombies). Doing so doesn't cost BP, but reduces the Morale of the donating army by 1.</p><p>At the GM's discretion, you may divide a resource among several smaller armies, so long as the total number of units in the smaller armies doesn't exceed the number of units in the donating army.</p><p>If you disband an army with a resource, you can give that resource to another suitable army, store it for later (such as an army you recruit next year), or sell it for half its BP value.</p>",
