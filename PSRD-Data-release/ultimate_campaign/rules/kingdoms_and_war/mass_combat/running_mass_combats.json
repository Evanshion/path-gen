    "body": "<p>Since an army's strength is represented by an ACR score, the GM can balance armies against each other using the guidelines for CR. For example, two ACR 9 armies should make for a relatively even battle, but so would an ACR 9 army against three ACR 6 armies. This applies mostly to typical humanoid armies, as monsters with powerful abilities might be significantly more formidable.</p>",
