    "body": "<p>If your army is the last one left on the battlefield (not counting other friendly armies), it is victorious. Each time an army wins a battle, you can attempt a Loyalty check against your kingdom's Control DC. If you succeed at this check, your army learns a new tactic and its Morale increases by 1 (maximum of Morale +4). If the army's current hit points are lower than the army's ACR, increase its hit points to its ACR. You may attempt a second Loyalty check; if you succeed, the army's commander learns a new boon.</p>",
