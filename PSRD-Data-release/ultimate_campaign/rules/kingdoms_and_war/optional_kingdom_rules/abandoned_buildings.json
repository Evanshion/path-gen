If this occurs, you lose the building's benefit and Unrest increases by 1.</p><p>If you build a replacement for the abandoned building, on the next Upkeep phase you may attempt an Economy check to activate the abandoned building; success means the abandoned building is occupied and provides its bonuses. If you fail, you may keep trying on the next turn.</p>",
