    "body": "<p>As explained in the Buildings section, the Settlement entry for a building lists modifiers that affect skill checks in the settlement (<i>GameMastery Guide</i> 204). If the GM wants these modifiers to influence the kingdom as a whole, add up the Settlement modifiers for all settlements in your kingdom, divide them by 10, and apply the following adjustments according to your kingdom's alignment: <i>Chaotic</i>+1 Crime; <i>Evil</i>: +1 Corruption; <i>Good</i>: +1 Society; <i>Lawful</i> +1 Law; <i>Neutral</i>: +1 Lore (apply this twice if the kingdom's alignment is simply Neutral, not Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Neutral). Use these total modifiers everywhere in your kingdom. If a settlement has its own settlement modifier, use the higher of the two modifiers for rolls relating to that settlement.</p>",
