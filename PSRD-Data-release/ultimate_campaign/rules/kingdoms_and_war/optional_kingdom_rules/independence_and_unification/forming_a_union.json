    "body": "<p>Just as a kingdom can divide into separate pieces, kingdoms may want to unite to become a more powerful political entity. If the leaders in each kingdom agree to the union, the process is relatively smooth. During the Event phase, follow these steps.</p><p>First, combine the Treasuries and any other mobile assets (such as armies) of the kingdoms. Next, determine how much Unrest in each kingdom is not from leadership and building modifiers. Average these numbers together (minimum 1 Unrest).</p><p>Then follow the steps for founding a kingdom . Treat leaders who change roles as changing roles within the same kingdom.</p><p>Once you've got your new, combined kingdom, add the Unrest from earlier to the Unrest for the new kingdom.</p><p>The GM may influence any of these steps as appropriate to the situation, such as giving hexes in the smaller kingdom a temporary Loyalty penalty for 1 year, or giving the entire kingdom a 1d4&mdash;2 Stability modifier each turn for 6 months.</p>",
