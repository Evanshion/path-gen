Your eidolon receives a +5-foot enhancement bonus to one type of speed it has that you do not, such as a climb or swim speed. If your eidolon doesn't already possess such a mode of movement, you may apply this trait bonus later if it gains an evolution that grants it such a mode. Once this bonus is applied to a mode of movement, it can't be switched to another mode.</p>",
