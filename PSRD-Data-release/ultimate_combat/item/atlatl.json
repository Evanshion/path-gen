    "body": "<p id=\"atlatl\">An atlatl is a thin piece of wood or antler used as a lever to hurl a specially fitted dart. An atlatl gives much greater range to a dart, but must be loaded like a projectile weapon. Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use an atlatl, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire&mdash;but not load&mdash;an atlatl with one hand. Loading an atlatl is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. The Rapid Reload feat can be taken for atlatls, allowing you to load a dart as a free action.</p>",
