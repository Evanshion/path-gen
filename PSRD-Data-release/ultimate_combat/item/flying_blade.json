You fight with a flying blade by spinning it about your head or by snapping it toward an opponent. The flying blade is a clumsy weapon and receives a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls, but when you make  attacks of opportunity provoked by movement, you receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls instead of the penalty.</p>",
