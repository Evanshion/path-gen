    "body": "<p id=\"kerambit\">This small, curved pull dagger has a metal loop at the base of its handle allowing it to be secured with a pinky or worn on a string tied in the hair. While relatively small, the curved blade can create brutal wounds. Easily concealed (the wielder gets a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand skill checks made to conceal a kerambit on her body), it is a favorite concealed weapon of ninja and assassins.</p>",
