    "body": "<p id=\"madu\">The madu is a round, light shield with two animal horns&mdash;usually from an antelope&mdash;extending from opposite sides of the shield. If you are proficient with the madu, you may use it to fight defensively with a &ndash;2 penalty instead of the normal &ndash;4, and your attack penalty for using Combat Expertise improves by +1 (minimum &ndash;1 penalty). You cannot hold anything else in the hand that bears a madu. If you are not proficient with the madu, treat it as a light spiked shield. </p>",
