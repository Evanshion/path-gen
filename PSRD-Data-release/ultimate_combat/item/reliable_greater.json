A <i>greater reliable firearm</i> is enchanted so as to be less likely to jam than other firearms. It reduces the misfire value of the affected firearm by 4 (minimum 0). This reduction occurs after any increases are calculated for firing with the broken condition, or for any other effect that might increase the misfire value of a firearm. A firearm with <i>greater reliable</i> cannot have the <i>reliable</i> special ability.</p>",
