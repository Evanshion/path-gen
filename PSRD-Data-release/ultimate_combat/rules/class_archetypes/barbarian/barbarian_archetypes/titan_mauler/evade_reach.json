    "body": "<p id=\"evade-reach\">At 5th level, as a swift action, a titan mauler may choose one creature within her line of sight. Until the end of her turn, that target's reach is treated as if it were 5 feet shorter with respect to reaching the titan mauler, and this reduction increases by 5 feet for every five levels beyond 5th. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.</p>",
