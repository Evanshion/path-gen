    "body": "<p id=\"uncontrolled-rage\">A wild rager's rage functions as normal, except that when she reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points, she must attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the barbarian's Constitution modifier) or become confused. For the remainder of her current turn, she attacks the nearest creature other than herself. On the following round, refer to the <i>confusion</i> spell to determine her actions. At the end of this round, and each round thereafter, she can attempt a new saving throw to end the <i>confusion</i> effect. The rounds during which she is confused do not count against the rounds she has spent raging that day, but she cannot end her rage voluntarily, nor can she use rage powers while confused.</p>",
