    "body": "<p id=\"wild-fighting\">At 2nd level, even when not raging, wild ragers often fight with reckless, savage abandon. A wild rager using the full-attack action can make one extra attack per round at her highest base attack bonus. Until the beginning of her next turn, however, she takes a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls and &ndash;4 penalty to AC. This ability replaces uncanny dodge. </p>",
