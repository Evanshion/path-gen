Once per day, when a barbarian with temporary negative levels ends her rage, she can attempt saving throws to remove a number of negative levels equal to the number of levels she could ignore while raging. A barbarian must have the renewed vitality rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</p>",
