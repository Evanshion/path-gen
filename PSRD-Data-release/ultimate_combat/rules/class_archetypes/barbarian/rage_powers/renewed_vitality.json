    "body": "<p id=\"renewed-vitality\" class=\"stat-block-2\">While raging, the barbarian ignores the effect of 1 point of ability penalty or damage per two barbarian levels she has (maximum 10). Once per day, when a barbarian with ability penalties or damage ends her rage, she can reroll a saving throw, if any, against an effect that imposed an ability penalty or dealt her ability damage. If successful, she removes an amount of ability penalty or damage equal to the amount she can ignore while raging. A barbarian must have the renewed vigor rage power and be at least 4th level before selecting this rage power.</p>",
