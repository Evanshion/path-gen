She also gains a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells and effects that have an alignment descriptor or come from an outsider or aberration. This bonus increases by +1 for each world serpent rage power the barbarian possesses, excluding this one. A barbarian must have the world serpent totem rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</p>",
