She gains a +2 bonus on her combat maneuver checks to attempt the chosen maneuver and to her CMD to resist that maneuver. At 6th level, and every four levels thereafter, the daredevil gains a +2 bonus for an additional type of combat maneuver. She may not choose the same maneuver twice. This ability replaces versatile performance.</p>",
