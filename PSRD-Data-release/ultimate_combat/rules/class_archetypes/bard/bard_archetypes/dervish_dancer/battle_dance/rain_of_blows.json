    "body": "<p id=\"rain-of-blows\" class=\"stat-block-2\">At 6th level, a dervish dancer can use his battle dance to speed up his attacks. When making a full attack action, he may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding, as though under the effects of a <i>haste</i> spell. He also gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and on Reflex saves. At 9th level, and every three bard levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1, to a maximum of +5 at 18th level. These bonuses do not stack with the <i>haste</i> spell. This ability replaces suggestion and mass suggestion.</p>",
