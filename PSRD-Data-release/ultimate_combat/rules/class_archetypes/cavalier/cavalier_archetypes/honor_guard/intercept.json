He gains Bodyguard (<i>Advanced Player's Guide</i> 151) as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisite. In addition, whenever the honor guard uses the aid another action to increase an ally's Armor Class, the bonus to Armor Class granted by the aid another action increases by +1. This ability replaces cavalier's charge.</p>",
