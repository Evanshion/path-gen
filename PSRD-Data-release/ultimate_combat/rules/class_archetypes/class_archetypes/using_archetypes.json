    "body": "<p>Each base class in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game draws upon a central idea, a basic concept representing the commonly held understanding of what a character of a certain class should be, and is designed to be useful as a foundation to the widest possible array of characters. Beyond that basic concept, however, exists the potential for innumerable interpretations and refinements. A member of the bard class, for example, might be an incorrigible archaeologist, a dashing swashbuckler, or a dangerously graceful dervish dancer, each refined by a player's choice of background details, class options, and specific rules such as feats to better simulate the character she imagines and make that character more effective at pursuing her specific goals.</p><p>Some character concepts are too close to existing classes to warrant unique classes of their own, yet prove pervasive and exciting enough that they come up in play time and again. For these situations, the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game has created archetypes&mdash;prepackaged modifications to abilities that can be easily swapped out of a given class to help customize its focus. To help players interested in creating iconic fantasy characters, the following pages explore new rules, options, and alternate class features for many different classes.</p><p>While the types of options presented for each base class differ, each subsystem and archetype is customized to best serve that class, emulate the abilities and talents of classic fantasy tropes, and expand players' freedom to design exactly the characters they desire.</p>",
