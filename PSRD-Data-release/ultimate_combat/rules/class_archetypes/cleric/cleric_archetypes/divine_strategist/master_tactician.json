    "body": "<p id=\"master-tactician\">A divine strategist can always act in a surprise round even if she fails to make a Perception check to notice enemies, though she is considered flat-footed until she acts. In addition, the divine strategist gains a bonus on initiative checks equal to 1/2 her cleric level. At 20th level, a divine strategist's initiative roll is automatically a natural 20. Allies able to see and hear the divine strategist gain a bonus on initiative checks equal to 1/4 the divine strategist's level. This is a language-dependent ability. This ability replaces channel energy.</p>",
