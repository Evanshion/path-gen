Whenever she is flanking or makes an attack of opportunity, she may add her Intelligence bonus (if any) as a bonus on the attack roll. In addition, once per day as a swift action she may add her Intelligence modifier as a bonus on any single d20 roll made as part of a readied action. She can use this ability one additional time per day for every two levels after 8th.</p>",
