This ability functions as the ape shaman ability, but the druid may select from the following sets of bonuses and abilities: movement (+10 enhancement bonus to land speed), senses (low-light vision, scent), natural weapons (gore [1d8 for a Medium druid], +2 on combat maneuver checks to overrun), or toughness (+2 natural armor bonus to AC, Endurance feat). While using totem transformation, the boar shaman may speak normally and can cast <i>speak with animals</i> (boars and related animals only) at will.</p>",
