    "body": "<p id=\"menacing-stance\">At 7th level, a brawler constantly harries and distracts his enemies. While adjacent to the brawler, enemies take a &ndash;1 penalty on attack rolls and a &ndash;4 penalty on concentration checks. These penalties increase by 1 for every four levels after 7th level (to a maximum of &ndash;4 on attack rolls and &ndash;7 on concentration checks at 19th level). Creatures do not take these penalties if the brawler is dazed, helpless, staggered, stunned, or unconscious. This ability replaces armor training 2, 3, and 4 and armor mastery. </p>",
