    "body": "<p id=\"buckler-defense\">At 15th level, a thunderstriker retains partial use of his buckler even when using a weapon in both hands or in each hand (rather than losing his shield bonus until the beginning of his next turn). He gains a +1 shield bonus to AC and may apply the benefits of any feats he knows that require the use of a shield, but does not benefit from any magical properties his shield may possess. This ability replaces armor training 4.</p>",
