    "body": "<p id=\"armor-training\">At 4th level, a gun tank learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever she is wearing armor, the armor check penalty is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by her armor increases by 1. Every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and 16th), the bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of a &ndash;4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase to the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed. This ability stacks with the fighter class ability of the same name. If the gun tank has both class features, she takes the most advantageous benefit of the two class features. This ability replaces the bonus feats the gunslinger gains at 4th level and every four levels thereafter.</p>",
