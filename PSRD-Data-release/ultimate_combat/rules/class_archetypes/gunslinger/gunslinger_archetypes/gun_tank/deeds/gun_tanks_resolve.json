    "body": "<p id=\"gun-tank's-resolve\" class=\"stat-block-2\">At 1st level, the gun tank can shrug off the most serious of attacks. When the gun tank is wearing medium or heavy armor and is subject to a critical hit or sneak attack, she can spend 1 grit point as an immediate action to attempt to negate the critical hit or sneak attack damage. At 1st level, she has a 25% chance of doing so. At 10th level, the chance increases to 50%. At 15th level, the chance increases to 75%. While a gun tank's resolve does not stack with the <i>fortification</i> armor special ability, it does work in concert with that armor special ability or similar effects, so a gun tank can use this ability even after the <i>armor of fortification</i> has failed to negate the critical hit or sneak attack damage. This deed replaces the gunslinger's dodge deed.</p>",
