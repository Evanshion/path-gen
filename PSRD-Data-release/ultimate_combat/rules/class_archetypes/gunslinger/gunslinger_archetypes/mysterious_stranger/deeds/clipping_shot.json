    "body": "<p id=\"clipping-shot\" class=\"stat-block-2\">At 11th level, when the mysterious stranger misses with a firearm attack, she can spend 1 grit point to deal half the damage that attack would have dealt if it were a hit (roll damage normally). She can decide to use this deed and spend the grit point after making the attack. This deed has no effect if the attack used the dead shot deed. The cost of using this deed cannot be reduced with the Signature Deed feat, the true grit class feature, or any similar effect. This replaces the bleeding wound deed.</p>",
