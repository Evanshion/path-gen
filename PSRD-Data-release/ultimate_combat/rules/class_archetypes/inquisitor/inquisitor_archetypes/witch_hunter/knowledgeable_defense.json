    "body": "<p id=\"knowledgeable-defense\">At 2nd level, a witch hunter who identifies a spell with Spellcraft gains a bonus against its effects, either a +1 bonus on saving throws or a +1 dodge bonus to AC against this spell. This bonus increases every four levels (to a maximum of +5 at 18th level). At 20th level, once per day as a swift action, she can grant this bonus to all her allies within 60 feet, for 1 minute. The allies gain the bonus when the witch hunter identifies the spell, and those among the allies who have at least 1 rank in Spellcraft can aid the witch hunter's next Spellcraft check as a swift action while under the effect of this ability. This ability replaces <i>detect alignment</i>, <i>discern lies</i>, and true judgment. </p>",
