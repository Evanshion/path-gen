    "body": "<p id=\"spell-scent\">At 6th level, the witch hunter learns how to sense unique spell signatures, and can follow the trail of a cast spell or spell effect cast back to its source. Once per day, when the witch hunter comes into contact with or is exposed to a spell effect or a magic item, she can spend a full-round action to examine the spell effect or magic item, and then gains the effect of a <i>locate creature</i> spell. She can do this even if the spell effect was instantaneous, but must start her examination within 1 round after she experienced the spell's effect. Instead of locating a known creature, the witch hunter locates the caster of the spell effect or magic item she examined. Doing so does not allow the witch hunter to gain any intelligence about the spellcaster other than its location. This ability replaces track.</p>",
