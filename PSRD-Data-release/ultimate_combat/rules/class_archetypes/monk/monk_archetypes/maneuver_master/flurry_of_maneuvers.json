    "body": "<p id=\"flurry-of-maneuvers\">At 1st level, as part of a full-attack action, a maneuver master can make one additional combat maneuver, regardless of whether the maneuver normally replaces a melee attack or requires a standard action. The maneuver master uses his monk level in place of his base attack bonus to determine his CMB for the bonus maneuvers, though all combat maneuver checks suffer a &ndash;2 penalty when using a flurry. At 8th level, a maneuver master may attempt a second additional combat maneuver, with an additional &ndash;3 penalty on combat maneuver checks. At 15th level, a maneuver master may attempt a third additional combat maneuver, with an additional &ndash;7 penalty on combat maneuver checks. This ability replaces flurry of blows. </p>",
