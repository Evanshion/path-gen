    "body": "<p id=\"monastic-mount\">At 4th level, a sohei may spend 1 point from his <i>ki</i> pool to grant his mount temporary hit points equal to twice his level for 1 hour per level. In addition, as long as the sohei and his mount are adjacent, including when mounted, the mount gains any of the following abilities the sohei possesses: AC bonus, diamond soul, evasion, high jump, improved evasion, <i>ki</i> strike (as long as the sohei has at least 1 point in his <i>ki</i> pool), perfect self, and still mind. When a sohei spends points from his <i>ki</i> pool, his mount gains the same benefits as the sohei. This ability replaces fast movement and increased unarmed damage.</p>",
