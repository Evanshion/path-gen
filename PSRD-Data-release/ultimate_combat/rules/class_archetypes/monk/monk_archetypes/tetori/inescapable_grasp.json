    "body": "<p id=\"inescapable-grasp\">At 9th level, a tetori can spend 1 point from his <i>ki</i> pool to suppress his opponents' <i>freedom of movement</i> and magical bonuses to Escape Artist or on checks to escape a grapple. At 13th level, this ability also duplicates the effect of <i>dimensional anchor</i>. At 17th level, the tetori's unarmed strike gains the <i>ghost touch</i> special ability, and an incorporeal creature that he strikes gains the grappled condition (Reflex negates, DC 10 + 1/2 the wrestler's level + his Wisdom modifier). Inescapable grasp is a swift action and lasts until the beginning of the wrestler's next turn. This ability replaces abundant step, improved evasion, timeless body, and tongue of sun and moon.</p>",
