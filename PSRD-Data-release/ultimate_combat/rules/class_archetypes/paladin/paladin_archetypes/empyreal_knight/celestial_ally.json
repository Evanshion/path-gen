    "body": "<p id=\"celestial-ally\">At 4th level, an empyreal knight can summon a celestial ally as a full-round action. This functions as <i>summon monster I</i>, except it can only be used to summon celestial creatures, archons, and angels. At 6th level, this improves to <i>summon monster II</i>, increasing by one spell level for every two levels thereafter, to a maximum of <i>summon monster IX</i> at 20th level. This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to the empyreal knight's Charisma modifier (minimum 1), but only one ally can be summoned at a time. This ability replaces lay on hands and channel positive energy. </p>",
