This ability functions with a caster level equal to her character level, and is always active.</p><p>At 18th level, as a swift action, the empyreal knight can manifest a protective aura against evil. Against abilities or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of her. It otherwise functions as a <i>magic circle against evil</i>. She can use this ability for a maximum of 1 round per day per paladin level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.
