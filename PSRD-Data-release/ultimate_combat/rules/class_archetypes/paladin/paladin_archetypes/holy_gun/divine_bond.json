    "body": "<p id=\"divine-bond\">At 5th level, a holy gun forms a bond with her deity. This functions as the paladin's divine bond ability, except the bond must always take the form of a firearm. In addition to the listed abilities, a holy gun can add the <i>distance</i>, <i>reliable</i>, or <i>seeking</i> special abilities to her weapon, but she cannot add the <i>defending</i> or <i>disruption</i> special abilities. This ability replaces the standard paladin's divine bond. </p>",
