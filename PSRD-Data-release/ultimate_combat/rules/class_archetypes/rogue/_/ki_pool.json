    "body": "<p id=\"ki-pool\" class=\"stat-block-2\">A rogue with this talent gains a small <i>ki</i> pool. This <i>ki</i> pool is similar to a ninja's <i>ki</i> pool, but the rogue's <i>ki</i> pool does not grant any extra attacks. The rogue gains a number of <i>ki</i> points equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). These <i>ki</i> points replenish at the start of each day. If she already has a <i>ki</i> pool, or gains a <i>ki</i> pool later, she gains half her Wisdom bonus (minimum 1) as bonus <i>ki</i> points to her <i>ki</i> pool. She can spend a ki point to gain a +10-foot bonus to movement until the end of her turn.</p>",
