    "body": "<p id=\"spellblast-bombs\">At 1st level, as a swift action, an arcane bomber can sacrifice one of his spells to empower the next bomb he throws during his turn. When he does, he gains a bonus to hit with the next bomb he throws before the end of his turn equal to the level of the spell he sacrificed, and a bonus to damage equal to twice the level of the spell. This ability replaces cantrips, but the arcana bomber gains the <i>detect magic</i> and <i>read magic</i> cantrips  and places them in his spellbook. He can cast either of these as 1st-level spells.</p>",
