    "body": "<p id=\"empower-siege-engine\">As a swift action, a siege mage can sacrifice one of his spells to empower the next attack he makes before the end of his turn with a siege engine he is bonded with. When he does, the siege engine attack gains a bonus on its attack roll or targeting roll equal to the level of the spell he sacrificed, and a bonus to damage equal to 3 &times; the level of the spell. This ability replaces cantrips, but the siege mage gains the <i>detect magic</i> and <i>read magic</i> cantrips  and places them in his spellbook. He can cast either of these as 1st-level spells.</p>",
