    "body": "<p id=\"mage-bullets\">A spellslinger is adept at transferring spell energy into his <i>arcane gun</i> attacks. As a swift action, he can sacrifice a spell and transform that energy into a weapon bonus equal to the level of the spell sacrificed on a single barrel of his firearm. With that weapon bonus the spellslinger can apply any of the following to his arcane bond: enhancement bonuses (up to +5) and <i>dancing</i>, <i>defending</i>, <i>distance</i>, <i>flaming</i>, <i>flaming burst</i>, <i>frost</i>, <i>ghost touch</i>, <i>icy burst</i>, <i>merciful</i>, <i>seeking, shock</i>, <i>shocking burst</i>, <i>spell storing</i>, <i>thundering</i>, <i>vicious</i>, and <i>wounding</i>. An arcane gun gains no benefit from having two of the same weapon special abilities on the same barrel. The effect of the mage bullets ability lasts for a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell sacrificed, or until this ability is used again to assign the barrel different enhancements. This ability replaces cantrips, but the spellslinger gains the <i>detect magic</i> and <i>read magic</i> cantrips  and places them in his spellbook. He can cast either of these as 1st-level spells.</p>",
