Regardless of variations in technique, all practitioners have a fluid fighting stance that emphasizes rapid, powerful kicks. The style's constant motion and graceful footwork lead many to mistakenly view practitioners as highly skilled dancers, a misconception that has allowed the technique to be taught in secret, the hidden weapon of the downtrodden and the oppressed. Openly martial versions of this style lose some of the dancelike qualities but retain the style's extraordinary kicking techniques and agility.<i>Feat Path</i>: Janni Style, Janni Tempest, Janni Rush.</p>",
