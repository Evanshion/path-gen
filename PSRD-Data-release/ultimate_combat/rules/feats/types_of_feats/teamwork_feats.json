    "body": "<p>Teamwork grant significant bonuses but only function under specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an ally with the same feat to have a specific position on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide no bonus if the listed conditions are not met. Note that allies who are paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act do not count for the purposes of these feats. Inquisitors and cavaliers have special class abilities that allow them to use teamwork feats even when their allies do not have the feats.</p>",
