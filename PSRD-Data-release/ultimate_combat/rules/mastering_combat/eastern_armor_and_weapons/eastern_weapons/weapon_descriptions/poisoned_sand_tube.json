    "body": "<p id=\"poisoned-sand-tube\">Resembling a slender bamboo or metal scroll case, this tube is filled with fine sand that is soaked or coated with inhaled or contact poison. When loaded with 3 doses of these types of poison, the wielder blows into the tube, dispersing the poisoned sand into her enemies' faces in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the cone is affected as if afflicted with 1 dose of the poison. Even when loaded with unpoisoned sand, the tube lets loose a powerful irritant, and an opponent struck must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude saving throw or be dazzled for 1 round. Once expended, the tube must be repacked before it can be used again. Repacking a tube requires a full-round action, or a standard action if the wielder has the Rapid Reload feat.</p>",
