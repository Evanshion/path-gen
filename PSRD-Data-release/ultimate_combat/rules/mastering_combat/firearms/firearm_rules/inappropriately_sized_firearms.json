    "body": "<p id=\"inappropriately-sized-firearms\">You cannot make optimum use of a firearm that is not properly sized for you. A cumulative &ndash;2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between your size and the size of the firearm. If you are not proficient with the firearm, a &ndash;4 nonproficiency penalty also applies. The size of a firearm never affects how many hands you need to use to shoot it, the exception being siege firearms and Large or larger creatures. In most cases, a Large or larger creature can use a siege firearm as a two-handed firearm, but the creature takes a &ndash;4 penalty for using it this way because of its awkwardness. </p>",
