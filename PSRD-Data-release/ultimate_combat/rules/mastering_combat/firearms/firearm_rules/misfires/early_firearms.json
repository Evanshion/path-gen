    "body": "<p id=\"early-firearms\" class=\"stat-block-2\">If an early firearm with the broken condition misfires again, it explodes. When a nonmagical firearm explodes, the weapon is destroyed. Magical firearms are wrecked, which means they can't fire until they are fully restored (which requires either the <i>make whole</i> spell or the Gunsmithing feat). When a gun explodes, pick one corner of your square&mdash;the explosion creates a burst from that point of origin. Each firearm has a burst size noted in parentheses after its misfire value. Any creature within this burst (including the firearm's wielder) takes damage as if it had been hit by the weapon&mdash;a DC 12 Reflex save halves this damage.</p>",
