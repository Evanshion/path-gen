    "body": "<p id=\"early-firearms\" class=\"stat-block-2\">When firing an early firearm, the attack resolves against the target's touch AC when the target is within the first range increment of the weapon, but this type of attack is not considered a touch attack for the purposes of feats and abilities such as Deadly Aim. At higher range increments, the attack resolves normally, including taking the normal cumulative &ndash;2 penalty for each full range increment. Unlike other projectile weapons, early firearms have a maximum range of five range increments. </p>",
