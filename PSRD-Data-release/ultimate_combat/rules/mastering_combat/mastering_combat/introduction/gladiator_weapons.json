    "body": "<p>Inspired by blood sports from ancient Rome and beyond, these unusual and sometimes bizarre weapons are perfect for pit fighters and performers of all stripes. Whether you're performing death-defying martial feats for the court of the king or fighting for your life in the seediest back-alley brawl-house, these weapons are sure to take the crowd's breath away. From the Indian madu&mdash;a specialized shield combined with sharpened antelope horns&mdash;to the scizore punching-blade to the simple amentum, which sends javelins flying farther and straighter than any humanoid arm, these weapons can easily add a blast of exoticism and the thrill of discovery to the jaded fighter who thinks she's seen it all.</p>",
