For all those pit fighters and gladiators&mdash;or local champions and lowborn heroes hoping to impress the queen with their mastery on the battlefield&mdash;this section offers a new rules subsystem designed to simulate fighting for acclaim rather than blood. Covered here are the various types of performance combat&mdash;from the most genteel exhibitions to ruthless blood sports, back-room betting brawls to gangland initiation fights&mdash;as well as rules regarding crowd responses and how to turn the onlookers to your side no matter what the situation.</p>",
