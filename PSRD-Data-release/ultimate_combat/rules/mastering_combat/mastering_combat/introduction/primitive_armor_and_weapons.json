This section presents primitive weapons and armor in great detail, beginning with the introduction of the fragile weapon quality and going on to present rules for conventional weapons and armor made from stone, bone, bronze, gold, and obsidian. From there, it introduces numerous weapons more common to primitive cultures than more established civilizations. Throwing arms called atlatls fling darts the size of javelins, while long clubs lined with shark teeth called great terbutjes are surprisingly effective at slicing through armor and flesh. No warrior headed into uncivilized lands can afford to underestimate these so-called &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; weapons&mdash;and players may decide that they fit perfectly with brave warriors coming from primitive backgrounds or who actively reject the trappings of more modern society. </p>",
