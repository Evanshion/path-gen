    "body": "<p>One of the worst&mdash;and best&mdash;moments in any siege is the point at which the horrified castle defenders look out from their walls and see the looming forms of siege engines rolling slowly and inexorably toward them. This section expands on the mechanics presented in the <i>Core Rulebook</i> to give you everything you need to know to run a fortress assault with massive and terrifying engines of war, including both direct-fire weapons&mdash;such as ballistae and their ilk&mdash;and arcing, indirect-fire weapons like catapults. In addition to these strictly mechanical and medieval constructs, this section also covers their more advanced successors, the huge and terrifying siege firearms and flamethrowers. Adding to this section are rules for equipment useful in direct fortress assaults (such as siege towers, bridges, and scaling ladders), special ammunition for siege engines, and rules for attacking particular parts of fortresses, such as gates and walls.</p>",
