    "body": "<p>The first thing a GM must do in a performance combat is determine the crowd's starting attitude. Typically a crowd starts out with an indifferent attitude toward each side, but it could start with an attitude that's a step higher or lower based on other circumstances. Favored champions of a fighting pit or a city may start at a higher attitude step, while outsiders, prisoners of war, or criminals may start at a lower attitude step. If you are running a series of combats, a crowd may start with a higher or lower starting attitude based on a combatant's or a group of combatants' performance in the last bout, which is determined by the number of victory points the individual or group has (see the Serialized Performance Combats section).</p>",
