    "body": "<p id=\"staged-combats:\"> Staged combats are less dangerous than knockout bouts. In these contests, combatants typically arrange to have blows that just barely land, so the hits are not registered as either nonlethal or lethal damage, but crowd reaction is determined in the same way as for normal battles. Staged combats often require advanced training (see the Stage Combatant feat). Those without advanced training can attempt to participate, but take a &ndash;6 penalty on attack rolls in order to make it seem like their attacks hit without doing real damage.</p>",
