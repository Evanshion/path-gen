Bone either replaces the metal components of the armor, or in the case of wooden shields, large pieces of bone or shell replace the wood.</p><p>Bone armor has a hardness of 5 and has the fragile armor quality. Masterwork bone armor also has the fragile quality, but magic bone armor does not. The armor/shield bonus of bone armor is reduced by 1, but in the case of studded leather, the armor check penalty is also reduced by 1 (to 0).</p>",
