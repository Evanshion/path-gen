    "body": "<p id=\"firewyrm\">This siege engine is a larger version of the firedrake. A firewyrm is too large to be transported to the battlefield in one piece and must be assembled once the component parts reach the battlefield. A firewyrm fires its gout of flame in either a 120-foot line or a 60-foot cone (crew leader's choice). Targets in the area take 6d6 points of fire damage (DC 20 Reflex save halves). A firewyrm with the broken condition that suffers a further mishap explodes, dealing its damage to all creatures within a 30-foot blast (DC 20 Reflex save halves). Firewyrms have a hardness of 10 and 140 hit points. One use of firewyrm ammunition costs 400 gp and weighs 40 pounds.</p>",
