    "body": "<p id=\"heavy\" class=\"stat-block-2\">These Gargantuan siege engines typically hurl large stones indirectly at a target (targeting DC 25). A heavy trebuchet's ammunition scatters on contact, dealing full damage to the target square and half its damage to creatures and objects within 30 feet of the target square (creatures can make a DC 25 Reflex save to halve the damage again). Heavy trebuchets have a hardness of 5 and 200 hit points. One use of  heavy trebuchet stones costs 40 gp and weighs 120 pounds.</p>",
