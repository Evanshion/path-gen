    "body": "<p id=\"communal-spells\">Communal spells function like other spells, except they allow you to divide the duration among multiple targets, treating each target as a subject of the spell. When you divide the duration, you must divide it as evenly as possible among the targets. Furthermore, unless the communal spell's description indicates otherwise, no target can receive a duration increment smaller than the smallest increment of duration listed in the spell description. For example, if you are 5th level, your communal spell's duration is 10 minutes per level, and you have four targets, each target must receive 10 minutes of duration. The extra 10 minute duration can go to one of the four targets or it is wasted.</p>",
