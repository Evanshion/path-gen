    "body": "<p id=\"natural-armor-bonus-and-dr\">Like a creature's armor bonus, a natural armor bonus is also converted into damage reduction. If a creature is wearing armor and has a natural armor bonus, the creature adds its armor bonus to its natural armor bonus to determine the amount of DR/armor that it has (see Table 5&ndash;2).</p><p>For instance, if a creature wearing a <i>+2 chain shirt</i> has DR 6/armor is then subject to a <i>barkskin</i> spell cast by a 6th-level druid (gaining a +3 natural armor bonus), its DR becomes DR 9/armor for the duration of the spell. This DR is bypassed by adamantine, or the attacks of Huge or larger creatures. </p><p>A creature that has both DR from a source other than armor and a natural armor bonus gains the effects of an enhanced form of DR, similar to how the composition of the armor grants special DR/armor defenses (see Table 5&ndash;1). If a creature has magical armor, natural armor, and DR, it takes the best form of the special protection provided by both its armor and its mix of DR and natural armor to its DR/armor. </p><p>For instance, if a creature has natural armor and DR/magic and is wearing adamantine armor, that creature's DR/armor functions as DR/&mdash;, and can be bypassed by Gargantuan or larger creatures, since the adamantine armor provides the best of the two damage reductions.</p>",
