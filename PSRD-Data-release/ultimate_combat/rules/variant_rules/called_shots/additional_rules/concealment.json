It's not possible to make a called shot against a creature with total concealment. For effects that function like concealment, such as <i>blink</i> and<i> displacement</i>, a miss chance of 50% or more prevents called shots, a miss chance of 20% increases to 50%, and miss chances of other values are doubled.</p>",
