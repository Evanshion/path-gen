    "body": "<p id=\"range-and-reach\">Called shots work best at close range. Melee called shots are at a &ndash;2 penalty if the target isn't adjacent to its attacker. For called shots made at range, all range penalties due to range increment are doubled, with a minimum penalty of &ndash;2 for any called shot against a target that's not within 30 feet.</p>",
