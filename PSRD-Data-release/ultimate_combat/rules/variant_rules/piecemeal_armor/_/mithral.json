Medium armor pieces that feature a reduced movement do not have a reduced movement when they are made from mithral. Heavy armor pieces that reduce the wearer's run speed to triple her speed instead of quadruple her speed do not do so when they are made from mithral or are part of a mithral armor suit.</p><p>As long as all the armor pieces a character wears are made of mithral, the spell failure chance decreases by 10%, the maximum Dexterity bonus increases by 2, and the armor check penalty decreases by 3 (to a minimum of 0). </p><p>An item made of mithral weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals. Armor pieces made of mithral are also considered masterwork. </p>",
