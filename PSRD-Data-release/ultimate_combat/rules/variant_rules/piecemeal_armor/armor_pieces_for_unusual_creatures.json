    "body": "<p>Armor pieces for unusually big creatures, unusually little creatures, and non-humanoid creatures (such as horses) have different costs and weights from those given in the Arm Armor, Leg Armor and Torso Armor tables. Refer to the appropriate line in the Armor for Unusal Creatures table and apply the multipliers to cost and weight. For animals with four or more legs, the armor for half of the legs counts as the leg armor piece, and the armor for the other half counts as the arm armor piece.</p>",
