    "body": "<p>Sometimes armor doesn't come in nicely matched sets, purchased straight from the armorer. Warriors may be forced to make do with tattered, hand-me-down sets cobbled together from various pieces, or else taken from the dead and defeated on the field of battle. Perhaps your character is a castaway forced to scavenge for what bits of armor she can find, or a resident of a post-apocalyptic setting in which everyone must scrounge through junk heaps and burned-out storefronts to acquire their equipment. Though such patchwork suits are almost always less effective than complete suits with pieces made to work together, the rules in this section provide everything you need to know about mixing and matching armor types.</p>",
