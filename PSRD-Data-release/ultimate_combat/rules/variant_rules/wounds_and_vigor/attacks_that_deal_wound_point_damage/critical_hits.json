    "body": "<p id=\"critical-hits\">When a creature is subject to a critical hit, the critical hit deals the damage normally, reducing vigor points first, and then reducing wound points when vigor points are gone. It also deals an amount of wound point damage equal to its critical multiplier (for example, 3 wound points for a weapon with a &times;3 modifier), on top of any wound point damage the creature might take from the critical hit. </p>",
