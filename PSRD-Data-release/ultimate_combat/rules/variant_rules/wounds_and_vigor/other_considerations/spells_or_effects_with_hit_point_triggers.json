    "body": "<p id=\"spells-or-effects-with-hit-point-triggers\">When using this system, if a spell or an ability has an effect that occurs when you reduce a creature to 0 or fewer hit points (such as the <i>disintegrate</i> spell), that effect is instead triggered when a creature is wounded. In the case of the <i>harm</i> spell or a similar effect where a creature cannot be reduced below 1 hit point by the spell or effect, a creature's wound points cannot be reduced to or below that creature's wound threshold. </p>",
