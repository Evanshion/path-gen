    "body": "<p id=\"healing-spells-and-effects\">When casting healing spells or using an ability with a healing effect (such as channeling holy energy on living creatures or the paladin's lay on hands ability), the creature casting the spell or using the effect must choose whether it wants to heal wound points or vigor points. The creature decides this before casting the spell or using the ability. When that creature decides to heal vigor points, the healing spell or effect acts normally, replenishing a number of vigor points equal to the number of hit points the spell or effect would normally heal. If the creature decides to heal wound points, it heals a number of wound points equal to the number of dice it would normally roll for the healing spell or effect. In the case of effects like the <i>heal</i> spell, where a spell or effect heals 10 hit points per caster level, the creature heals its caster level in wound points. </p><p>For instance, if a 12th-level cleric uses her channel positive energy power to replenish wound points to living creatures, she would typically heal 6 wound points for all living creatures with her channel energy burst. If she casts the <i>heal</i> spell, she would restore 12 wound points to the creature touched. </p>",
