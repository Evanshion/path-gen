If the driver takes no action, takes some other action instead of driving the vehicle, or delays or readies an action&mdash;or if there is no driver&mdash;the vehicle takes the &ldquo;uncontrolled&rdquo; action. A driver can only take one action each turn to control a vehicle. Once the driver has selected the action, or takes some other action forcing the vehicle to become uncontrolled, the vehicle moves. </p>",
