The targets suffer no hindrances to movement and suffer no penalties on Acrobatics and Stealth checks from undergrowth in forested terrain. Furthermore, forested overgrowth imposes a miss chance 10% lower than normal. </p><p class=\"stat-description-indent-1\">When moving in and among trees, those subject to the spell gain a +5 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks and Climb checks. Rangers in their favored terrain can also add their favored terrain bonus on such Acrobatics and Climb checks.</p>",
