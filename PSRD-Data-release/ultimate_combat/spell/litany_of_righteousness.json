    "body": "<p class=\"stat-description-2\">Calling down a litany of anathema, you make an evil more susceptible to the attacks of good creatures. If the target is evil, it takes double damage from attacks made by creatures with a good aura (from a class feature or as a creature with the good subtype). If the target also has the evil subtype; when it is hit with attacks made by creatures with a good aura, it is also dazzled for 1d4 rounds. If this spell targets a nonevil creature (or one that lacks the evil subtype), it has no effect, and the spell is wasted.</p><p class=\"stat-description-indent-1\">While subject to this spell, the target cannot be the target of another spell that has the word &quot;litany&quot; in the title.</p>",
