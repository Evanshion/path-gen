This effect on your magical reserve has no effect on any discoveries that you use to modify your bombs, but you can only have one admixture effect (formula with the word &ldquo;bomb admixture&rdquo; in its title) active at a time. If you drink another bomb admixture, the effects of the former bomb admixture end and the new one becomes active.</p><p class=\"stat-description-indent-1\">When you throw bombs, they can only hit a direct target; they do not splash. However, the bomb deals its base damage plus double your Intelligence modifier instead of just its base damage plus your Intelligence modifier. </p>",
