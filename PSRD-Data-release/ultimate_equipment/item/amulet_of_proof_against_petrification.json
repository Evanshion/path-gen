    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This finely polished wooden amulet has the image of a blindfolded medusa carved upon its surface. Whenever the wearer fails a saving throw that would result in him being turned to stone, he is instead staggered for 1d6 rounds. If a spell or effect turns him to stone without allowing a saving throw, he is instead staggered for 1 minute. These abilities do not function while the wearer is staggered.</p>",
