A transmuter can use these spectacles to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard transmutation spell into any other wizard transmutation spell he knows; the desired spell must be of the same level or lower than the prepared spell. Once per day, he may use the spectacles to spontaneously cast <i>disintegrate</i> in place of one of his prepared transmutation wizard spells of 6th level or higher, even if he doesn't know that spell.</p>",
