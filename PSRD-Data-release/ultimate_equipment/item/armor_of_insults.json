    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Each metal bit of this suit of <i>+1 studded leather</i> looks more like a tiny sneering face than a simple stud. Once per day the wearer of the armor may command the mouths to unleash a torrent of verbal abuse directed against every hostile creature within 60 feet who can see and hear the wearer. Each such creature must make a DC 16 Will saving throw to avoid suffering an overwhelming compulsion to attack the wearer for the next 7 rounds. If the creature is unable to attack the wearer on its next turn, or attacking the wearer would put the creature at risk (moving through a threatened square, charging into a pit, and so on) it can act normally that turn. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect, and has no effect on creatures that do not use a spoken language.</p>",
