They appear similar to a set of <i>bracers of archery</i>, but a wearer notices the difference as soon as she dons them.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The wearer of these bracers gains damage reduction 5/magic against ranged weapons, as well as a +1 deflection bonus against ranged attacks. In addition, once per day, as a swift action, the wearer can grant herself a +20 insight bonus on her next ranged attack roll before the end of her next turn.</p>",
