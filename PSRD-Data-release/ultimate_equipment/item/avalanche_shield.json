    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">The front of this <i>+1 bashing heavy steel shield</i> looks as though it is crafted from hundreds of bits of rubble and larger stones. When used to make a shield bash attack, stones fall from shield and cling to the target of the shield bash. The target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or be entangled for 1d4 rounds. Once per day on command, the target's wielder can choose to petrify the target of a shield bash instead. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw or become petrified for 1 minute.</p>",
