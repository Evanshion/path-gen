    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">The <i>beacon of true faith</i> takes the form of an ornate torch made of electrum. It holds an undying magical flame that requires no fuel or air, and in the hands of most creatures it simply functions as an everburning torch. When held by a divine spellcaster, an outsider with an alignment subtype, or a creature of strong religious faith (GM's discretion, but usually requiring a feat or trait reflecting this devotion), the beacon gains additional powers based on the bearer's alignment. For example, a lawful good paladin gains access to the lawful and good powers, but a neutral cleric gains access to no powers. All of these are command-word activated.</p>",
