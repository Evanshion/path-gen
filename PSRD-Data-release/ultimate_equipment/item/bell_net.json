A bell net is designed to blanket gear while you sleep, hunt, cook, or otherwise can't give it your full attention, rasing an alarm if your possessions are disturbed. Creatures attempting to access gear protected by a bell net must succeed at a DC 25 Sleight of Hand check to avoid chiming the bells. Hearing the chiming bells of a bell net requires a DC 0 Perception check. Because the many bells chime when you move, traveling with a bell net gives you a &ndash;2 penalty on Stealth checks.</p>",
