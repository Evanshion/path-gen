Once per day on command, the wearer can summon the spirit of a hero of one of the depicted battles. This spirit acts as an <i>unseen servant</i>, though unlike the force created by that spell, the summoned hero is not entirely mindless<i>.</i> While the summoned hero is active, it attempts to guide its wearer to victory via telepathic warning and advice, granting its user a +1 insight bonus on all saving throws.</p>",
