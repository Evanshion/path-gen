    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This surprisingly soft belt has an absurdly large buckle, made even more absurd by the fact that it's crafted in the shape of a smiling weasel's face. It grants its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, and the ability to move at half normal speed while prone. Treat the enhancement bonus to Dexterity as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn. The wearer does not take a penalty on melee attack rolls or to AC against melee attacks while prone. Additionally, the wearer gains the compression ability.</p>",
