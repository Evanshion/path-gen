If the character is a spellcaster, the robe targets the character's primary spellcasting score, otherwise it targets <span class=\"hyperlink-1\">Intelligence. The robe can be removed easily, but in order to restore mind and body, the character must receive a <i>remove curse</i> spell followed by <i>heal</i>. </span></span></span></span></p>",
