    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This bottle is crafted from the darkest ebony. When opened and held upright, faint whispers can be heard emanating from the bottle's mouth. The bottle initially has 4 charges. When turned upside down, the bottle summons a shadow to do the bidding of the user, draining 1 charge each round of service. As a standard action, the bearer may dismiss the summoned shadow. If the shadow kills a humanoid creature of at least 4 HD, the bottle gains 1 charge. The bottle is automatically restored to 4 charges at sundown.</p>",
