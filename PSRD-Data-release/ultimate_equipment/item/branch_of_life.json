Full of everlasting life, it needs time to transfer its magic. It can cast <i>heal</i> at will, but needs a full hour to do so. Once a day, it can cast <i>resurrection</i>, but it takes the full day to do so. </p><p class=\"stat-block\">The branch serves only those who are worthy. It will not stay in the possession of a non-good creature for long, disappearing in 1d4 days. It will similarly disappear while in the possession of a good creature who associates with nongood creatures, but this takes 2d8 days to occur.</p>",
