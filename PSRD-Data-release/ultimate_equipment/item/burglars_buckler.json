A burglar's buckler grants the wielder a +2 competence bonus on Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks, combat maneuver checks made to perform dirty tricks, and to CMD against dirty tricks.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Once per day on command, the wielder may transform a <i>burglar's buckler </i>into any mundane tool weighing 1 to 5 pounds, such as a crowbar, hammer, saw, small shovel, grappling hook, artisan's tools, or thieves' tools. The <i>burglar's buckler </i>retains its normal hardness and hit points in this form and can be converted back into shield form on command.</p>",
