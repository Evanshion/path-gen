    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">One end of this 6-foot-long pole supports a wide metal hoop covered by a thin mesh net. You can use this to sift objects from material capable of passing through the net, such as sand or water. You can also use a butterfly net to capture Fine or Diminutive creatures as if it were a net (weapon), though you don't need to re-fold the butterfly net if you miss, and you use the handle of the butterfly net like you would the rope of a net weapon. </p>",
