    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This shining white cloak is trimmed with golden sunbursts and continuously radiates light (as per the <i>light </i>spell, but only in a 10-foot radius). Twice per day, the wearer can command the cape to erupt in a burst of light, blinding all creatures other than the wearer within 20 feet for 1d4 rounds (Reflex DC 14 negates). After triggering this burst, the wearer becomes invisible (as the <i>invisibility</i> spell, with a duration of 1 minute) and the cape's light is extinguished as long as the wearer is invisible.</p>",
