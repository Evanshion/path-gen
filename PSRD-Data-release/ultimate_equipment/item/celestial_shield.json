It has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance, and it allows the wielder to use <i>feather fall</i> on himself once per day. A creature wearing <i>celestial armor</i> while wielding a <i>celestial shield</i> may command the armor to provide <i>overland flight</i> rather than <i>fly</i> once per day.</p>",
