    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This 6-inch-wide, perforated metallic vessel resembles a thurible found in a place of worship. The censer must be filled with incense to function. On command as a full-round action, the bearer may summon an air elemental. If the censer is filled with <i>incense of meditation</i>, it conjures a greater air elemental as if using <i>summon monster VII</i>. If filled with any other incense, it conjures a Large air elemental as if using <i>summon monster V</i>. Conjuring an elemental consumes any normal incense in the censer, or one-fourth of a block of incense of meditation. The censer cannot summon another elemental until the previous one is dismissed, killed, or the duration of its summoning expires.</p>",
