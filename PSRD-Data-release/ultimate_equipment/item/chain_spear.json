    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This vicious weapon is often used in gladiatorial events due to its versatility. The body of the weapon is a standard short spear, primarily used for thrusting. The butt of the spear is fitted with a length of chain, often spiked, with a hook at the end. The hook and chain may be used to make trip attacks. If your trip attack fails by 10 or more, you may drop the chain spear to avoid being knocked prone.</p>",
