You can wield the chakram as a melee weapon, but it is not designed for such use; you take a &ndash;1 penalty on your attack roll with the weapon and must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or cut yourself on the blade (half damage, no Strength modifier). You do not need to make this save if wearing heavy armor.</p>",
