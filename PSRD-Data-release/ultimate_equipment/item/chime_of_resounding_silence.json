    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This foot-long tube of gold absorbs nearby sound when struck, as if it were the target of a <i>silence</i> spell. This ability can be used once per day. The chime vibrates silently for the next 5 rounds, increasing in strength as time passes. On the bearer's turn each round there is a cumulative 20% chance that the chime prematurely ends the magical silence and releases the pent-up sound as a <i>shout</i> spell as a free action, oriented in a random direction. The bearer may spend a standard action to strike the vibrating chime again, ending its <i>silence</i> early and unleashing the <i>shout</i> in a direction of his choosing. If dropped while vibrating, the chime automatically gains the broken condition and releases the <i>shout</i> effect in a random direction. A broken <i>chime of resounding silence </i>cannot be used until it is repaired. The chime has no effect if struck in an area of <i>silence</i> it did not create.</p>",
