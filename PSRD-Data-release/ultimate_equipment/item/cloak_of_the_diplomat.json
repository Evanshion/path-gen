    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">The forest-green cloak grants a +5 competence bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks. In addition, once per day, before making a Diplomacy or Sense Motive check, the wearer can decide to call upon the powers of the cloak to roll twice and take the better result. Finally, the wearer of this cloak can adjust a creature's attitude up to three steps when using Diplomacy, instead of the normal limit of two steps. However, the cloak's power does have one drawback. Should the wearer ever fail a Diplomacy checks made to adjust a creature's attitude by 5 or more, the creature's attitude is reduced by two steps instead of one.</p>",
