If a human, half-elf, or half-orc flips the coin and catches it, she takes a &ndash;2 penalty to the ability score modified by her +2 racial ability score bonus, but gains a +2 inherent bonus to a random other ability score. The bonus and penalty last for 1 hour. Negating the penalty automatically negates the bonus as well. The coin can be used three times per day.</p>",
