    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Although it appears to be a simple thong of leather, this collar was initially conceived by druids who believed that there were animals who possessed spirits worthy of elevation to true sentience. If worn by a creature of the animal type with an Intelligence less than 3, a <i>collar of the true companion</i> grants a +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence. This does not give the animal the ability to speak, but it does allow it to understand one spoken language (chosen by the item's creator).</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If the collar is worn for at least 1 week by a creature of the animal type, the creature is raised to humanlike sentience, as though by the <i>awaken </i>spell. Once this occurs, the collar loses its magical properties.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If a <i>collar of the true companion</i> is worn for more than 1 week by a creature not of the animal type, the wearer is <i>feebleminded</i> until the collar is removed.</p>",
