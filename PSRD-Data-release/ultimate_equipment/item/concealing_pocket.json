    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This 4-inch-square cloth pocket has no powers unless it is sewn onto a garment (which takes 1d4 minutes). Once sewn, it changes its appearance to match the garment. Any magic item inside it cannot be magically detected, as if protected by <i>magic aura</i>. Hiding an item in the pocket gives the garment's wearer a +5 competence bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal the item. The pocket can be removed from the garment with a DC 10 Heal check or an appropriate Craft check such as Craft (cloth) or Craft (leather); failing this roll by 5 or more gives the pocket the broken condition.</p>",
