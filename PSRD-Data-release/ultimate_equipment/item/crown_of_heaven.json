She also gains a +5 sacred bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks regarding outsiders with the good or evil subtypes, and any effect she creates with the good descriptor takes effect at +1 caster level.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A <i>crown</i>, an <i>orb</i>, and a <i>scepter of heaven</i>&mdash;collectively known as a <i>regalia of heaven</i>&mdash;increase in power when used together. If the wearer of a <i>crown of heaven </i>wields an <i>orb</i> or <i>scepter of heaven</i>, effects she creates with the good descriptor gain an additional +1 caster level, and she gains a +1 sacred bonus to AC and on saves against attacks or effects created by evil creatures. She also radiates an <i>aura of menace</i> in a 20-foot radius. Any evil creature within this aura takes a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls, on saving throws, and to AC until it successfully hits the wearer of the regalia (DC 20 Will negates). A creature that saves is immune to this effect for 24 hours. If the aura is dispelled, the wearer can restore it as a standard action.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If the crown is worn while the wearer is wielding both an <i>orb</i> and <i>scepter of heaven</i>, the crown's caster level increases to 15th, effects the wearer creates with the good descriptor gain an additional +1 caster level increase, and her sacred bonus to AC and saves increases to +2. In addition, as a full-round action, the wearer can create an <i>aura of sanctity </i>for as long as she concentrates. This aura provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, as well as the benefits of a <i>magic circle against evil </i>and a <i>lesser globe of invulnerability. </i></p><p class=\"stat-block\">A <i>crown of heaven </i>bestows one negative level on any evil creature bearing it, which cannot be removed or overcome while carrying the crown. If the same creature carries an <i>orb </i>or <i>scepter of heaven, </i>it gains one additional negative level per object. An evil creature intentionally donning a <i>crown of heaven </i>gains an additional negative level and is affected as <i>bestow curse </i>(DC 17) immediately and every 24 hours that the crown is worn. A neutral character can attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save to avoid gaining these negative levels.</p>",
