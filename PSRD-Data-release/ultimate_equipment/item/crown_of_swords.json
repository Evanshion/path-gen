When struck in combat, the wearer may spend one use as an immediate action to create a longsword-shaped <i>spiritual weapon</i> that then attacks her attacker. On the wearer's next turn, she may spend one additional use each round to continue attacking that target with the <i>spiritual weapon</i>; the <i>spiritual weapon</i> cannot be redirected and disappears if the target is killed or moves out of range. Multiple <i>spiritual weapons</i> may be created (even attacking the same target) if the wearer is attacked in subsequent rounds.</p>",
