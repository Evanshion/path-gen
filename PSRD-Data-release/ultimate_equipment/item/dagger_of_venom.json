    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This black <i>+1 dagger </i>has a serrated edge. It allows the wielder to use a <i>poison</i> effect (as the spell, save DC 14) upon a creature struck by the blade once per day. The wielder can decide to use the power after he has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the poison effect must be invoked in the same round that the dagger strikes.</p>",
