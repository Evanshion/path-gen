A gunslinger with the deadeye deed reduces the grit point cost to use that deed by 1 (minimum 1 grit).</p><p class=\"stat-block\">In addition, once per day when the wearer reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm she can use <i>death knell</i> (Will DC 13 negates) against that target as a swift action. She does not have to touch the target to activate this ability, but her range increment penalty for shooting the target also applies to the saving throw DC of the <i>death knell</i> (for example, if the range increment penalty is &ndash;2, the DC is 11).</p>",
