Elaborately detailed feathered wings spread from the hilt to form the guard, with the angel's face at the base of the blade. This <i>+3 cold iron holy demon bane elven curve blade</i> hinders those it was created to destroy. It bars all creatures with the demon subtype that are within 60 feet of the wielder from teleporting, as if they were under the effect of a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell (no saving throw).</p>",
