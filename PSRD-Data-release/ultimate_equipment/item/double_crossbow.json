    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This heavy weapon fires a pair of iron-tipped bolts with a single squeeze of the trigger. Because of its size and weight, you take a &ndash;4 penalty on your attack roll if you're proficient with it, or &ndash;8 if you're not. If the attack hits, the target takes damage from both bolts. Critical hits, sneak attack damage, and other precision-based damage apply to only the first bolt. Reloading one bolt is a standard action; the Rapid Reload feat reduces this to a move action. Crossbow Mastery allows you to reload both bolts as a move action. A double crossbow fires crossbow bolts.</p>",
