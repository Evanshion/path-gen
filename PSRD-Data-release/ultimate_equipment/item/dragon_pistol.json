    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Like a miniature blunderbuss, the dragon pistol fires pellets or a bullet from its flared barrel. The dragon pistol fires in a 15-foot cone when firing pellets, and has a 10-foot range increment when firing a bullet. A dragon pistol uses either a bullet or group of pellets and 1 dose of black powder, or a single alchemical cartridge (with either bullets or pellets) as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>",
