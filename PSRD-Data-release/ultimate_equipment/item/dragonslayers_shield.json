The wearer of this shield gains a +2 bonus on Reflex saves against effects that originate or burst from a point outside his own square, as though he had cover. It does not protect against spread effects. This bonus does not stack with that granted by actual cover or give cover to any creature other than the wearer. In addition, the <i>dragonslayer's shield</i> grants its wielder a +2 morale bonus on Will saves against the frightful presence ability.</p>",
