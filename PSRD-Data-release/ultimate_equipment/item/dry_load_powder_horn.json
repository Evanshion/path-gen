    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This horn holds 20 doses of black powder for firearms. When a firearm is loaded with black powder directly from this horn, the horn creates a small pocket of air that envelops the gun and allows that shot to be fired underwater or in an area lacking air, such as a vacuum. Once the gun is loaded with powder from the <i>dry load powder horn</i>, it retains the pocket of air for 10 minutes or until the firearm is fired, whichever comes first.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Firing a firearm that has been loaded from this horn underwater still incurs the &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to the normal penalties to range. When a shot loaded from a <i>dry load powder horn</i> results in a firearm explosion while underwater or in an airless environment, that explosion occurs normally.</p>",
