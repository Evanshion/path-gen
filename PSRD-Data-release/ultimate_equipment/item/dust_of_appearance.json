A single handful of this substance flung into the air coats objects within a 10-foot radius, making them visible even if they are invisible. It likewise negates the effects of <i>blur</i> and <i>displacement</i>. In this, it works just like the <i>faerie fire</i> spell. The dust also reveals figments, mirror images, and projected images for what they are. A creature coated with the dust takes a &ndash;30 penalty on its Stealth checks. The dust's effect lasts for 5 minutes.</p>",
