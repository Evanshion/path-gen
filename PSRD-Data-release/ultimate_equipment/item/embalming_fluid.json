    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This fluid is used to preserve corpses, whether for later dissection, taxidermy, necromancy, or magic such as <i>raise dead</i>. Embalming fluid is technically a poison, and using it makes a corpse unpalatable to most animals and vermin, though corpse-eating undead don't mind the taste. Treating a corpse with embalming fluid takes 1 hour and a successful DC 25 Heal check. The embalmed corpse decays at half the normal rate (each day dead counts as half a day for the purpose of <i>raise dead</i>).</p>",
