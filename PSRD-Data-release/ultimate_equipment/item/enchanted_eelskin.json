    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This <i>+1 slick leather armor </i>is made of shining, slippery eelskin that allows the wearer to move with deadly grace and sudden swiftness, especially underwater. When immersed in water, <i>enchanted eelskin </i>gains the <i>shadow </i>property and grants the wearer a swim speed of 30 feet and the ability to breathe water. In addition, during a surprise round the wearer can act as if she had a full round of actions, rather than a single standard action, as long as those actions do not require leaving the water. If she does leave the water, her surprise round turn immediately ends.</p>",
