    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">The <i>eye of the void</i> normally appears to be a small black glass or crystal ball 3 to 4 inches in diameter. However, when commanded to open, the eye reveals itself as the terrifying, multi-pupilled eye of some abomination from the dark spaces between the stars. Once per day, the bearer may hold the eye and speak one of two command words to open the eye. The first word creates a gaze effect in a 30-foot cone. The second word creates a gaze effect in a 15-foot sphere. Each creature subject to the gaze must make a DC 16 Will save; success means the creature is shaken for 1 minute, failure means it becomes frightened for 1 minute and takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>",
