    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">These crystal lenses fit over the user's eyes, enabling him to cast <i>doom</i> upon those around him (one target per round) as a gaze attack, except that the wearer must take a standard action, and those merely looking at the wearer are not affected. Those failing a DC 11 Will save are affected as by the <i>doom</i> spell. The wearer also gains the additional power of a continual <i>deathwatch</i> effect and can use <i>fear</i> (Will DC 16 partial) as a normal gaze attack once per week. Both lenses must be worn for the magic item to take effect.</p>",
