    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">These glasses look like golden teeth holding a pair of green-tinted lenses. The wearer may use <i>eyebite</i> 11 times per day on command, affecting one target for each use of the spell. The wearer does not need to use these rounds consecutively, but each activation is a standard action (unlike the spell, in which targeting a new foe is a swift action). If the wearer removes the glasses, the <i>eyebite</i> effects immediately end.</p>",
