A filter hood uses your helm slot and imposes a &ndash;2 penalty on hearing- and sight-based Perception checks. While the sponges are moist, the hood grants you a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against inhaled poisons and other airborne attacks that require you to breathe them. Moistening the sponges with water is a standard action. The sponges dry out after 1d4 &times; 10 minutes and should be thoroughly rinsed after each use.</p>",
