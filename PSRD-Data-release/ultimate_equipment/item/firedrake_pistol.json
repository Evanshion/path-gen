    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This hefty <i>+1 flaming pistol </i>is elaborately carved with its barrel in the semblance of a roaring dragon and its grip wrapped in polished red dragonhide. When firing ordinary ammunition, the wielder may choose to have the <i>firedrake pistol </i>deal all of its damage as fire damage instead of normal damage. In addition, as a standard action the wielder may expend 1 unit of ammunition and create a cone of fire equivalent to <i>burning hands </i>rather than resolving that shot as a normal attack.</p>",
