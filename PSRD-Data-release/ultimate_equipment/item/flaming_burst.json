The fire does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra fire damage from the <i>flaming</i> ability (see above), a <i>flaming burst</i> weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of fire damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is &times;3, add an extra 2d10 points of fire damage instead, and if the multiplier is &times;4, add an extra 3d10 points of fire damage.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Even if the <i>flaming</i> ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra fire damage on a successful critical hit.</p>",
