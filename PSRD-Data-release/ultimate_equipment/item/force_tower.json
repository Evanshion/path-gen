    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This <i>+1 arrow deflection ghost-touch mithral tower shield </i>glows with a perpetual bluish radiance. Infused with magical force, a <i>force tower </i>renders its wielder immune to <i>magic missiles </i>and also allows its wielder to use its <i>arrow deflection </i>special ability to deflect magical rays and ranged touch attacks. The Reflex save DC to deflect such attacks is equal to 20 + the level of the spell (or 1/2 the class level or Hit Dice of the creature that created the effect, if a supernatural effect). If a spell or effect creates multiple rays or attacks, the <i>force tower </i>deflects only one of them per round.</p>",
