    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">As black as coal, this short sword grows more potent the farther it is kept from light. It acts as a <i>+1 short sword </i>when in dim light. In darkness, it acts as <i>+2 short sword</i>. When surrounded by supernatural darkness, such as in an area of <i>deeper darkness</i>, it acts a <i>+2 short sword</i> and bestows the benefit of the Blind-Fight feat on its wielder. In daylight or bright illumination, the sword temporarily loses all its magical enhancement bonuses and acts as a masterwork weapon, though it resumes its magical functions once it is no longer in the bright light.</p>",
