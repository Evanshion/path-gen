    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A <i>glorious </i>weapon glows with a dazzling light equal to a <i>daylight </i>spell when drawn. The wielder cannot suppress this light, though it can be temporarily suppressed by any effect that can suppress <i>daylight</i>. A <i>glorious </i>weapon flashes with light, and any creature the wielder attacks in melee is automatically dazzled until the beginning of the wielder's next turn. When a <i>glorious </i>weapon confirms a critical hit, the target is blinded until the beginning of the wielder's next turn (DC 14 Will negates); if the weapon's critical multiplier is greater than &times;2, this blindness lasts 1 additional round per multiple over &times;2. Only a melee weapon can have the <i>glorious</i> ability. </p>",
