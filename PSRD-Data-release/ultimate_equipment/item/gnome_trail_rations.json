    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Almost any preserved food can be found in gnome trail rations, which are designed to keep a wandering gnome from needing to dine on the same meal twice in a week. If you are a gnome who subsists on nothing but these rations for at least 1 week, you are treated as being 1 Hit Die higher for the purposes of spells and supernatural abilities that have variable effects based on Hit Dice, such as <i>color spray</i> and <i>sleep</i>. This does not actually improve your caster level, character level, or Hit Dice in any other way. This benefit lasts until you eat a meal other than the rations or go for a full day without eating a day's worth.</p>",
