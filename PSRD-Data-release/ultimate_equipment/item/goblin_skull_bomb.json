    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">An ember glow lights the beady eyes of this blackened, burned out goblin's skull. It is very brittle and shatters if dropped on solid ground. When a <i>goblin skull bomb</i> breaks, the very last creature to touch it bursts into a raging magical flame, automatically suffering 5d6 points of fire damage and also catching fire should it fail a Reflex save (DC 13). If this kills the creature, its body burns away in one round, leaving behind only a pile of ash and the creature's blackened, burned-out skull, which is a new <i>goblin skull bomb</i>. If the target survives the fire, doesn't have a skull, or if its skull is destroyed before another creature touches it, it does not create a new <i>goblin skull bomb</i>.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A skull bomb can be used as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. If the attacker hits, the skull shatters, immolating the target as described above. If the attacker misses, the skull breaks upon the floor or another nearby hard surface and the attacker bursts into flame. Touching the skull using gloves, gauntlets, or handheld items such as tools or weapons counts as touching the skull. It can be safely moved using spells (such as <i>mage hand</i> or <i>telekinesis</i>) or attacked with ranged weapons (hardness 0, 1 hp).</p>",
