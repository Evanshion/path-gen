    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This long, loose-fitting coat grants a +4 armor bonus to AC and a +2 luck bonus to the wearer's touch AC against firearm attacks. If the wearer is a gunslinger or has the Amateur Gunslinger feat (see <i>Ultimate Combat</i>), she begins each day with 1 additional grit point. This extra point does not increase her maximum grit total. When the wearer uses the gunslinger's dodge deed, the deed's dodge bonuses to AC increase by +1. If the wearer is not a gunslinger, she may use the gunslinger's dodge deed once per day.</p>",
