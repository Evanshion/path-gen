    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">When placed over the head, this halo of shimmering polished steel floats above it, though it still takes up the head slot. The halo constantly radiates a 20-foot-radius aura from its wearer. Any hostile creature within the aura must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or take a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls, on saving throws, and to AC for the next 24 hours or until it hits the wearer with an attack or damages it with a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability. Chaotic creatures take a &ndash;2 penalty on this saving throw. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect of the <i>halo of menace</i> cannot be affected by the same wearer's aura for 24 hours. The aura is a mind-affecting effect.</p>",
