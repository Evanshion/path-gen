    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Crafted from the flayed skin of a barbed devil, this imposing <i>+2 spiked hide armor</i> weighs half the normal weight. When its wearer rages, the armor's spikes elongate and the hide bonds to her skin, providing fire resistance 10. Any creature that strikes the wearer with a melee weapon, unarmed strike, or a natural weapon while the spikes are elongated takes 1d8+6 points of piercing damage from the armor's barbs (unless using a weapon with reach). While the wearer is enraged, spells that cause additional damage to evil outsiders deal that increased damage to her.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A barbarian with fiend totem rage powers gains additional benefits from <i>hamatula hide</i>. If she has the lesser fiend totem rage power, she gains a +1 profane bonus to Armor Class while raging. If she has the fiend totem rage power, the damage caused by her barbs increases to 2d8+6 and stacks with the barbed defense granted by the armor. If she has the greater fiend totem ability, she gains fire resistance 20 when raging.</p>",
