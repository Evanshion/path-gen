    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This finely crafted masterwork harp fits comfortably in one hand, but it requires two hands to play. The harp has 10 charges. By making a DC 10 Perform (string) check, the bearer can produce the following effects:</p><ul><li><i>break</i> (1 charge)</li><li><i>shatter</i> (2 charges)</li></ul><p class=\"stat-block\">When the last charge is expended, the harp loses all of its magic but still functions as a masterwork harp.</p>",
