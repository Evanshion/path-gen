The spirit servants are invisible, mindless, shapeless beings that act as servants summoned by the <i>unseen servant</i> spell. The spirits return to the shoes after 3 hours have passed. The wearer can choose to dismiss one or more of the spirit servants early.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Once per day, the wearer can command the ghostly spirits inside her <i>haunted shoes </i>to emerge and swirl around her, making her difficult to target in combat. The wearer gains concealment (20% miss chance) for 3 minutes. The spirits cannot be harmed, but a <i>true seeing</i> spell ignores the concealment effect. The concealment effect cannot be activated while any of the spirits are currently being used as <i>unseen servants.</i></p>",
