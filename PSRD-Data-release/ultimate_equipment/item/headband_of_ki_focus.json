Whenever the wearer spends <i>ki</i> points to make an additional attack, that attack roll gains a +1 insight bonus (+2 if the wearer is using a <i>ki focus</i> weapon with that attack). Furthermore, the wearer of a <i>headband of ki focus</i> is immune to the ninja's <i>ki</i> block trick or similar effects that block the wearer from using <i>ki</i> points.</p>",
