    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This <i>+1 unholy scorpion whip</i> (<i>Ultimate Combat</i> 144) is fashioned from skin flayed from a barbed devil's back. It grants its wielder a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks. A shaken creature struck by the <i>hellscourge</i> must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or become frightened for 1 round. A frightened or panicked creature struck must instead save or cower for 1d4 rounds. Both of these are mind-affecting fear effects.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If wielded by a person who wears <i>hamatula hide</i> armor, the <i>hellscourge</i> functions as a <i>+1 flaming unholy whip</i>. Such a wielder can lash the whip once per day to hurl flames as a <i>scorching ray</i> (creating two rays); doing so extinguishes the whip's flames until the next day.</p>",
