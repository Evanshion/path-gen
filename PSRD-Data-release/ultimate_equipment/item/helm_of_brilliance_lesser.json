    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This helm functions like a <i>helm of brilliance</i> but is lower-powered. Instead of the standard helm's allotment of gems, the lesser helm has 10 diamonds (<i>fireball</i>, 10d6 damage, Reflex DC 20 half), 20 corals (<i>flaming sphere</i>), 30 garnets (<i>scorching ray</i>), and 40 agates (<i>light</i>). It still glows near and harms undead, has the <i>flaming</i> weapon special ability, and provides fire resistance (though only 20 instead of 30).</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Just like the standard helm, the wearer risks detonation if damaged by magical fire; diamonds become <i>fireballs</i> centered on the wearer, corals become <i>flaming spheres</i> in and adjacent to the wearer's space, garnets become <i>scorching rays</i> that fire randomly at creatures in range, and the agates and the helm itself are destroyed.</p>",
