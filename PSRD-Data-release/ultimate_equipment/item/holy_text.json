    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This is the religious text of a particular religion, with a title, text, and detailed rites specific to that faith. The cheap variety is a small, light book with no illustrations, printed or written on thin paper, and with a cover made of canvas or thin leather. A typical holy text for an experienced adventuring priest is durable, with a leather cover, chapter illustrations, quality paper; it costs 25 gp and weighs 2 pounds. The most expensive versions have detailed illustrations, gilded initials and border decorations, covers made of fine leather, wood, or even metal, and are often oversized and difficult to carry around.</p>",
