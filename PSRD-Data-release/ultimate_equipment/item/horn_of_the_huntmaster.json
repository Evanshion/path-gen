    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This elongated bull's horn curves sharply at the end, almost making it seem more like an enormous smoking pipe than a tool for the hunt. Once each day, a person with the hunter's bond (companions) class feature may blow the horn as a standard action; this grants his full favored enemy bonus (instead of half) against a single target to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. The effect lasts for 1 minute.</p>",
