    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">When a horse is shod with these horseshoes, they give off a puff of mist each time a hoof strikes the earth. On the rider's command, the mount and the rider are both affected as if subject to a <i>gaseous form</i> spell. If for some reason the rider and the mount become separated from one another while in <i>gaseous form,</i> the effect automatically ends for both. The horseshoes can be used for 10 minutes per day. The duration need not be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.</p>",
