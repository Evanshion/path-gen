    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This tiny hourglass is filled with blood-red sand. The sand flows only one way and turning it to start the flow activates its magic. It grants a target creature within 30 feet the following benefits for a limited time&mdash;<i>freedom of movement</i> (as the spell), and suspends any and all of the following conditions: blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded, insanity, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, and stunned. These effects are suspended rather than dispelled; they resume when the hourglass is deactivated or expended and this suspended time does not count toward the duration of the suppressed effect.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Ending the hourglass's effects is a swift action. The hourglass can be used for up to 5 rounds in total before its magic is consumed. These rounds need not be consecutive.</p>",
