    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Usually made from the skins of giant serpents, these cloaks are designed to help rangers, hunters, and trackers blend in with and travel quickly through the areas they are most familiar with. If the wearer has the favored terrain class ability and is traveling through one of his favored terrains, once per day he can transform himself into an animal native to that environment. This works identically to the <i>beast shape I</i> spell, save that it is limited to creatures native to the environment (as defined in the appropriate <i>Bestiary</i> entry or per the GMs discretion). This effect lasts for 10 minutes per day. The duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>",
