    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This <i>+1/+1 quarterstaff </i>is hollow, drilled through with numerous tiny holes, and whistles when swung and spun. Once per day as a standard action, the wielder may spin the <i>hurricane quarterstaff </i>and create a <i>gust of wind</i> (DC 13 Fortitude negates). A monk or ninja wielding a <i>hurricane quarterstaff </i>can also spend 1 <i>ki </i>point to activate the staff's <i>gust of wind </i>power; the save DC when activating this power with <i>ki </i>is equal to 12 + the wielder's Wisdom modifier.</p>",
