A creature struck by a <i>hushing arrow</i> must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be affected by <i>silence</i> (as the spell) for 5 rounds. The <i>silence</i> effect is not triggered by arrows that miss or those that strike an inanimate object.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A <i>greater hushing arrow</i> functions just like a normal <i>hushing arrow</i>, except the target must succeed at a DC 16 Will save to avoid being silenced. <i>Hushing bolts</i> and <i>greater hushing bolts</i> can also be made; they share the same statistics as <i>hushing arrows</i> and <i>greater hushing arrows</i>, except they weigh 1/10 of a pound per bolt.</p>",
