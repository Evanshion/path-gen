    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This exotic dessert is made with milk and cream, often flavored with fruit or mint. Because it quickly melts at room temperature, it must be made fresh from snow or ice, or maintained at a low temperature, such as in a cold cellar or with alchemy or magic. This limitation means it is expensive and in most lands it is only available during certain seasons. The listed price is for a large scoop (1 cup).</p>",
