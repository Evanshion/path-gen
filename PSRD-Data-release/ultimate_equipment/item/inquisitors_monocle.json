This monocle helps draw out the truth of things, and was originally created to aid in the investigation of crimes and the questioning of witnesses. Twice per day on command, it can create a <i>zone of truth, </i>as per the spell. In addition, this monocle grants its wearer a +5 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks. Though it fits over only one of the wearer's eyes, the item takes up the entire eyes slot.</p>",
