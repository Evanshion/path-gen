    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This fine gray powder causes targets to suffer from uncontrollable itching until they spend at least 1 round washing it off. Throwing a packet of itching powder is a splash attack with a range increment of 10 feet. Anyone standing on the square of impact must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save to resist the powder, while those in adjacent squares must make a DC 8 Fortitude save. Creatures that fail the save take a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks until they wash the powder off. This is a poison effect. Crafting this item is a DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.</p>",
