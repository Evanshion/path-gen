    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">The price of jewelry varies wildly by its quality. Many cultures, particularly nomads, consciously use jewelry as a form of portable wealth, most notably with belts and bangles made from coins. A commoner's ornaments may only be worth a few copper pieces, an artisan's a few silver pieces, and a merchant's a few gold pieces, while nobles rarely wear jewelry worth less than 100 gp. </p>",
