They bestow a +4 bonus on CMD, and grant the wearer the ferocity ability (<i>Bestiary </i>300). On command, the wearer can increase its size, as though subject to an <i>enlarge person</i> spell, and can revert to regular size with another command. Three times per day, as an immediate action after the pauldrons' wearer kills an opponent, the wearer gains the benefit of the <i>deadly juggernaut</i> spell for 1 minute.</p>",
