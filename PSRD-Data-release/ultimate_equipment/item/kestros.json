    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">The kestros is an oddly shaped Bronze Age sling used for launching kestros darts. Your Strength modifier applies on damage rolls when you use a kestros, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire&mdash;but not load&mdash;a kestros with one hand. Loading a kestros is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. Halflings treat the kestros as a martial weapon.</p>",
