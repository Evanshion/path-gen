Each hour its owner spends sitting on the mat without taking any other action, he can attempt to center himself by making a Wisdom check with a DC of 10 + the monk's current number of <i>ki</i> points (note that ability checks, like skill checks, do not automatically succeed on a 20). If the check is successful, the monk regains 1 <i>ki</i> point.</p>",
