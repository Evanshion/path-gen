However, you can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow with one hand at a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a light crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.</p>",
