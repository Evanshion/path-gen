    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This special ability can only be placed on one-handed or two-handed firearms. A <i>lucky </i>firearm has its own magical reservoir of grit (see <i>Ultimate Combat</i>). Usually this grit is stored within the marks of an engraving or in a trinket that hangs from the firearm. Often these marks take the form of holy symbols or fetishes, but such a reservoir can take just about any form. This reservoir holds 1 grit point, which is refreshed at the start of each day. Whether or not the wielder of a <i>lucky</i> firearm has any deeds (see <i>Ultimate Combat</i>), she can always spend 1 grit point from the <i>lucky</i> firearm to reroll an attack from it that would result in a misfire. When the wielder does so, she must take the second result, even if that attack roll also results in a misfire.</p>",
