Manacles have hardness 10 and 10 hit points. </p><p class=\"stat-block\">Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock you want to the price of the manacles. </p><p class=\"stat-block\">For the same price, you can buy manacles for a Small creature. For a Large creature, manacles cost 10 times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, 100 times the indicated amount.
