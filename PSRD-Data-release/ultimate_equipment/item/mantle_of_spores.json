    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This mantle grants the wearer a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against disease. Once per day, the wearer can flourish the cape as a swift action to surround himself with a cloud of deadly spores. Creatures adjacent to the wearer take 1d6 points of damage from the spores, plus 1d3 points of damage per round for 3 rounds as the spores grow into fuzzy green mold. After these rounds the mold becomes harmless, and can be washed away with a minute of scrubbing. The spores can be destroyed by making a DC 15 Heal check on an affected creature, or by effects that remove diseases. The spores are a disease effect.</p>",
