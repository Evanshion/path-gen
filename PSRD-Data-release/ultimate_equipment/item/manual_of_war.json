Once per day, after studying the manual for 1 hour, a fighter may exchange one of her fighter bonus feats for another combat feat. She must meet the prerequisites for this new feat and she cannot alter a feat she is using as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. This change persists for 24 hours, after which time the fighter's feats return to normal. The fighter may spend 10 minutes studying the manual to end its effects early.</p>",
