    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This simple leather mask depicts an earless catlike creature. When worn, it melds into its wearer's face and vanishes, leaving the wearer's face just as it looked before. Three times per day the wearer can command the mask to appear to retract the wearer's skin, revealing an illusion of the wearer's glistening skull and musculature. Creatures within 100 feet who see this display must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or become frightened (if the target has 6 or fewer Hit Dice) or shaken (if the target has more than 6 HD) for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect and a glamer. Anyone who can see through illusions (such as by <i>true seeing</i>) is unaffected.</p>",
