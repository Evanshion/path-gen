While in this form, the wearer can breathe water and transform her lower body into a merfolk fishtail. Her new form provides a +2 natural armor bonus and a swim speed of 30 feet, though while the wearer is in this form her land speed is reduced to 5 feet. The wearer can take this form for up to 12 hours, and can end the effect at any time with a command. </p>",
