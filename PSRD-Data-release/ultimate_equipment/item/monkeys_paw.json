    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This dimension-hopping artifact waits patiently until a creature picks it up. Each time it is picked up by a new user, the <i>monkey's paw</i> grants that creature three <i>wishes,</i> as if it were a <i>ring of three wishes</i>. Once a new user picks up the <i>monkey's paw</i>, it cannot be discarded, not even by way of a <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i> spell. Even if stolen, it reappears among the user's possessions within 1d4 hours. It can only be parted from its bearer when all three of its wishes are used or it is destroyed&mdash;but such a feat takes time and patience. When a bearer uses a <i>wish </i>granted by the <i>monkey's paw</i>, he is then subject to a curse, as per the spell <i>major curse</i> (DC 25 to remove; <i>Ultimate Magic</i> 215). This curse manifests as the creature taking a &ndash;4 penalty to attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks until the curse is removed. These penalties are cumulative in cases where multiple <i>wishes</i> are used before past curses are removed. Once all three <i>wishes</i> are used, the monkey paw <i>plane shifts</i> to a random plane and begins the process anew.</p>",
