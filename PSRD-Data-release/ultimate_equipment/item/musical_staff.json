    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This staff is made from high-quality wood and festooned with brass rods and keys, looking almost like an instrument. The staff allows use of the following spells:</p><ul><li><i>Ghost sound </i>(1 charge)</li><li><i>Piercing shriek</i> (1 charge)</li><li><i>Sculpt sound </i>(2 charges)</li><li><i>Wall of sound </i>(2 charges)</li></ul><p class=\"stat-block\">In addition, as a swift action, the wielder of the <i>musical staff</i> can cause it to transform into a string or wind instrument. Any Perform skill checks made with the <i>musical staff</i> gain a +5 competence bonus. The staff can still be used to cast spells while it is an instrument, and it can revert back to a staff as a free action.</p>",
