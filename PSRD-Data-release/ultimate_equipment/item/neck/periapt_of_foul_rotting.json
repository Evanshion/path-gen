    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This engraved gem appears to be of little value. If any character keeps the periapt in her possession for more than 24 hours, she contracts a terrible rotting affliction that permanently drains 1 point of <span class=\"hyperlink-1\">Dexterity, <span class=\"hyperlink-1\">Constitution, and <span class=\"hyperlink-1\">Charisma every week. The periapt (and the affliction) can be removed only by application of a <i>remove curse</i> spell followed by a <i>cure disease </i>and then a <i>heal ,  miracle ,  limited wish</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell. The rotting can also be countered by crushing a <i>periapt of health</i> and sprinkling its dust upon the afflicted character (a full-round action), whereupon the <i>periapt of foul rotting</i> likewise crumbles to dust. </span></span></span></p>",
