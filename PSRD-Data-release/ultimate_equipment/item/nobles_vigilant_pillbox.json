    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This heart-shaped charm is set with three pearls: one white, one silver, and one black. Inside, a tiny compartment usually contains smelling salts (page 101) or alchemist's kindness (page 100). Each pearl has a primary, passive ability and a secondary, active ability that activates if it is removed from the setting and swallowed (a standard action, as if drinking a potion). Swallowing a pearl destroys it. A command word activates the primary abilities of all three pearls for 1 round.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">When activated, the white pearl detects poison in a 10-foot radius around the wearer, dulling to a dark gray if poison is within range. If swallowed, it grants the benefit of a <i>delay poison</i> spell. </p><p class=\"stat-block\">The silver pearl detects diseases in a 10-foot radius, turning bright blue on discovery. If swallowed, it grants the benefit of a <i>remove disease</i> spell.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The black pearl turns white if any invisible creature is within 10 feet of the wearer. If swallowed, it grants the benefits of <i>see invisibility</i> for 1 minute. </p><p class=\"stat-block\">A charms found with missing pearls has its price reduced appropriately; a white pearl is worth 750 gp, a silver pearl is worth 1,150 gp, and black pearl is worth 1,700 gp. </p>",
