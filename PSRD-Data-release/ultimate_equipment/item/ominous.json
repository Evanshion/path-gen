    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. An <i>ominous </i>weapon trails a shadowy haze behind every stroke, and moans a menacing dirge in battle. An <i>ominous </i>weapon adds its enhancement bonus on Intimidate checks made by the wielder. In addition, when an <i>ominous </i>weapon confirms a critical hit, the target is shaken for 1 minute (DC 13 Will negates); if the weapon's critical multiplier is greater than &times;2, this condition lasts 1 additional minute per multiple over &times;2. A creature that gains the shaken condition from an <i>ominous</i> weapon cannot gain that condition again from the same weapon for 24 hours.</p>",
