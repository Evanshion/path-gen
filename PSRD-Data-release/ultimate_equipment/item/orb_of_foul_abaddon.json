When held in hand, it can be commanded to unleash a <i>dread bolt</i> once per day. When used as an additional focus for casting a spell with the evil descriptor, the bearer gains a +1 bonus to her caster level for these spells. It bestows one permanent negative level on any good creature holding or carrying it. The negative level remains as long as the creature has the orb and disappears immediately when the orb is no longer held or carried. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by <i>restoration</i> spells) while the bearer has the orb.</p>",
