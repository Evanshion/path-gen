    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This alabaster sphere, overlaid with golden bands set with diamonds in runelike patterns, sheds light like a <i>continual flame</i> spell. Making a melee touch attack with the orb has the same effect as dousing the target with a flask of holy water. A good creature may hold the orb in hand and command it to invoke <i>consecrate</i> and <i>searing light</i> each once per day.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The orb bestows one permanent negative level on any evil creature holding or carrying it. The negative level remains as long as the creature has the orb and disappears immediately when the orb is no longer held or carried. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by <i>restoration</i> spells) while the bearer has the orb.\u2029If the bearer of an <i>orb of golden heaven</i> wears a <i>crown of golden heaven</i>, its light counts as <i>daylight</i> instead of <i>continual flame</i>, and its <i>consecrate</i> acts as if the orb were a shrine to the bearer's deity.</p>",
