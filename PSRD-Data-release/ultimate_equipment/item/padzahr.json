Resting for 1 hour after drinking a vial heals you of 1 point of Constitution damage as if you had benefited from a full night's rest. Taking multiple doses in an hour does not increase the rate of healing; you must take each individually, followed by an hour of rest, for it to have any effect. Using more than 4 doses of padzahr in 1 day has no effect.</p>",
