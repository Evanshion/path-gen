    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">These steel and brass pauldrons feature two brass lion heads, one on each shoulder. Twice a day as an immediate action when a creature successfully makes an Acrobatics check to move through the wearer's threatened area or its space without provoking an attack of opportunity, a shadowy lion can animate from one of the pauldrons and attack that creature. The attack uses the wearer's base attack bonus + Dexterity modifier and attacks the target's touch AC. On a hit, the lion deals 2d6 points of piercing damage (&times;2 critical).</p>",
