    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This potent preparation causes a creature who drinks it to fall madly in love with the first creature he or she perceives after consuming it. The drinker's attitude toward that creature becomes helpful. If a romantic attraction is possible toward the first person viewed, the drinker falls in love with that person. Otherwise, the drinker's love is a platonic adoration. The effects of the philter are permanent unless removed by a <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, or <i>wish</i>.</p>",
