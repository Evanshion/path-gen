    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Carvings of winter scenes decorate this set of pan pipes. Activating the pipes requires a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check. Creatures within 30 feet gain a +2 competence bonus on caster level checks to dispel magical effects and overcome spell resistance. Maintaining the performance is challenging, requiring a move action and a new Perform check each round, with the DC increasing by +1 for each round the instrument is played. The magic ends when the player voluntarily stops or fails the Perform check, after which the pipes cannot be used again for 1 hour.</p>",
