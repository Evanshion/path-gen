    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This leather pouch is usually decorated with a druidic motif.  Within is an extradimensional space that can hold 4 cubic feet or 40 pounds worth of items and otherwise functions as a small <i>bag of holding</i>. If the bearer uses a polymorph effect or wild shape to transform into an animal, dragon, elemental, magical beast, plant, or vermin, the pouch never merges with her body. It automatically relocates to an easily-accessible place on her body (such as on a belt or a cord around her neck), allowing her to access the pouch and items within it while she is transformed.</p>",
