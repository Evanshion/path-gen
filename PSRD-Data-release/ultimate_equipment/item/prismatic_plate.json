    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This resplendent suit of <i>+3 full plate</i> shimmers and shifts between all the colors of the rainbow. A single color dominates the others at any given time. As a swift action, the wearer can change the dominant color. This color remains dominant until the wearer changes it again. When the wearer of <i>prismatic plate</i> is struck by a <i>prismatic spray,</i> or when he passes through a <i>prismatic sphere</i> or <i>prismatic wall</i>, he ignores the effect that matches the dominant armor color. He receives no special protection against the other colors of those spells. In addition to this benefit, each color provides a unique type of protection.</p>",
