    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This special ability can only be placed on firearms. A <i>reliable </i>firearm is enchanted so that it is less likely to jam than other firearms. This enchantment reduces the misfire value of the affected firearm by 1 (minimum 0). This reduction occurs after any increases are calculated for firing with the broken condition, or for any other effect that might increase the misfire value of a firearm.</p>",
