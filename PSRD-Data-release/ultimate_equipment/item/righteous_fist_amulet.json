    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This golden amulet is used by religious sects as a way to help the faithful capture fugitives or defend themselves without doing undue harm to potential converts. While the wearer is using her divine powers of retribution (such as a cleric's smite, an inquisitor's smiting judgment, or a paladin's smite), the amulet grants her the ability to make unarmed strikes in melee combat as if she had the Improved Unarmed Strike feat.</p>",
