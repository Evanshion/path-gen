    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Rings of this type come in a wide variety of designs and colorations, typically related to the types of energy they defend against. These rings continually protect their wearers from damage from one type of energy&mdash;acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic (chosen by the creator of the item; determine randomly if found as part of a treasure hoard). Each time the wearer would normally take such damage, subtract the ring's resistance value from the damage dealt.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A <i>minor ring of energy resistance</i> grants 10 points of resistance. A <i>major ring of energy resistance</i> grants 20 points of resistance. A <i>greater ring of energy resistance</i> grants 30 points of resistance.</p>",
