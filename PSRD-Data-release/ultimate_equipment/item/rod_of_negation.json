    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This device negates the spell or spell-like function or functions of magic items. The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a pale gray beam shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray functions as a <i>greater dispel magic</i> spell, except it only affects magic items. To negate instantaneous effects from an item, the rod's wielder needs to have a readied action. The dispel check uses the rod's caster level (15th). The target item gets no saving throw, although the rod can't negate artifacts (even minor artifacts). A <i>rod of negation </i>can function three times per day.</p>",
