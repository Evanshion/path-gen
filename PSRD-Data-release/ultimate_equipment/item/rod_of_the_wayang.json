When the rod's wielder casts a spell of the shadow subschool, she increases the DC of that spell's saving throw by 1. Furthermore, once per day on command, wielder can treat positive and negative energy effects as if she were an undead creature, taking damage from positive energy and healing damage from negative energy. This ability lasts for 1 minute unless dismissed as a free action.</p>",
