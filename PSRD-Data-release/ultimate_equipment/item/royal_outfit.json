A royal outfit is rarely designed for regular wear or inclement weather&mdash;or even for donning unaided&mdash;as it's presumed that anyone who might be wearing it has plenty of servants to take care of his or her every need. This outfit includes only the clothing, not a royal scepter, crown, ring, or other regal accoutrements. </p>",
