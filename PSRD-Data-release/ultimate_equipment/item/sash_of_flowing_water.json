    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">If this belt's wearer has at least one hand free (holding nothing), he can attempt to deflect a successful melee attack with an immediate action. To do so, he rolls an unarmed strike against the opponent, including any applicable modifiers such as a favored enemy bonus or the penalty for Power Attack. If his attack roll is greater than the opponent's attack roll, the attack is negated without effect. The unarmed strike itself causes no damage and does not count as a successful attack against the opponent. The opponent does not need to be within the wearer's reach to use this ability. Whether the attack succeeds or not, the wearer takes a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls until the end of his next turn.</p>",
