Inscribed with flowing magical script that purports to reveal the inner secrets of magic, the <i>scimitar of the spellthief</i> grants the wielder a +2 bonus on Spellcraft and Use Magic Device checks. The scimitar also reveals magical auras by touch; this functions as <i>detect magic </i>but affects only a single object or creature at a time, which must be touched with the blade while the wielder concentrates on detection, and the magical auras revealed are clearly visible to all.</p>",
