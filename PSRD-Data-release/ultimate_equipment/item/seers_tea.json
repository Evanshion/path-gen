When the tea is brewed without a filter and imbibed, the drinker can read the patterns in the leaves remaining at the bottom of her cup, gaining the benefits of an <i>augury</i> spell.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Additionally, the unbrewed tea can be used as an extra material component when casting <i>augury</i>, removing the need for a focus. In this case, the caster instead reveals information as if she had cast <i>divination</i> instead.</p>",
