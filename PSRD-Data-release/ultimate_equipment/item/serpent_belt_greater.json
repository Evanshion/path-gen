    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This belt functions as a <i>serpent belt</i>, except it grants the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn. When the wearer animates the belt as a venomous or constrictor snake, she may speak a second command word to give the snake the advanced, celestial, entropic, fiendish, or resolute simple template. Adding a planar template changes the snake's alignment to that of the corresponding planes.</p>",
