Both the crescent and the tip of the hilt are sharpened for combat. They can be wielded as single weapons or with two-weapon fighting styles. These weapons gain the disarm special feature when they are used individually. A pair of shang gou can also be formed into a single one-handed weapon to gain the trip special feature.</p>",
