    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This intimidating weapon appears to be a longsword with multiple hooks, barbs, and serrations along the blade, excellent for catching and sundering a foe's weapon. Wielders without the Improved Sunder feat use a <i>shatterspike</i> as a <i>+1 longsword</i> only. Wielders with the Improved Sunder feat instead use <i>shatterspike</i> as a <i>+4 longsword</i> when attempting to sunder an opponent's weapon. <i>Shatterspike</i> can damage weapons with an enhancement bonus of +4 or lower.</p>",
