When the spell on the scroll is cast, another scroll of a spell the wielder knows randomly manifests to replace it. The shield has no arcane spell failure. The shield can also <i>read magic</i>. It will often debate with its wielder for the most devastating course of action, but does what the wielder commands.</p>",
