The electricity does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra electricity damage from the shock ability, a <i>shocking burst</i> weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of electricity damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is &times;3, add an extra 2d10 points of electricity damage instead, and if the multiplier is &times;4, add an extra 3d10 points.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Even if the <i>shock</i> ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra electricity damage on a successful critical hit.</p>",
