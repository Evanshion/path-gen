    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">These short black shoes fit tightly around the wearer's feet and bear designs of leaping arcs of lightning and wild winds. Once per day on command, a creature wearing these boots can transform into lightning and move up to 50 feet in a straight line, re-materializing at the far end of the lightning bolt. Creatures in the path of the lightning take 6d6 points of electricity damage and objects take damage as per the <i>lightning bolt</i> spell. If the lightning strikes an object or barrier and fails to burst through it, the creature wearing the boots appears next to the impacted object and is staggered for 1 round. Movement while in lightning form does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>",
