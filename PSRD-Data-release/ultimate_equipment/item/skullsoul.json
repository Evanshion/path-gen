    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This grim, alabaster figurine is the size of a human skull with an elaborately sculpted base. The <i>Skullsoul</i> is inert until it is bonded with a living creature. It then becomes a powerful and never-questioning companion. The <i>Skullsoul</i> functions as a demilich without the devour soul, rejuvenation, telekinetic storm, and torpor abilities, and with a hardness of 10. It is under the complete control of whoever bonds with the skull. Bonding with the <i>Skullsoul</i> is a ritual that takes 24 hours to perform, and doing so is an evil act. Paladins and good clerics who do so become ex-paladins and ex-clerics respectively. If they wish to atone, they must intercede with their deities (expending 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings) and must promise to contain the skull.</p>",
