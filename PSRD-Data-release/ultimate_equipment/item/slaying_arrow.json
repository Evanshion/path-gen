    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This <i>+1 arrow</i> is keyed to a particular type or subtype of creature. If it strikes such a creature, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 50 points of damage. Note that even creatures normally exempt from Fortitude saves (undead and constructs) are subject to this attack. When keyed to a living creature, this is a death effect (and thus <i>death ward</i> protects a target). To determine the type or subtype of creature the arrow is keyed to, roll on the table below.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A <i>greater slaying arrow</i> functions just like a normal slaying arrow, but the DC to avoid the death effect is 23 and the arrow deals 100 points of damage if the saving throw is failed.</p>",
