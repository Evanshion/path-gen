However, she may only walk on air within or on top of natural or magical mist or fog, including fog-like gases such as those created by <i>acid fog, cloudkill, incendiary cloud</i>, or <i>stinking cloud</i>. Walking on top of such clouds carries no danger for the wearer, but walking through the cloud has its normal effect.</p>",
