You are always treated as averting your gaze when dealing with gaze attacks, and you gain a +8 circumstance bonus on saving throws against visual-based attacks (any attack that a blind creature would be immune to). You take a &ndash;4 penalty on Perception checks while wearing the goggles, and all opponents are treated as having concealment (20% miss chance).</p>",
