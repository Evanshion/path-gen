    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This crystalline carving looks like a hand-sized tree leaf. It is usually worn around the neck on a strap so it is within easy reach, but can be affixed to a belt or clothing just like a badge. Activating a <i>snapleaf</i> is an immediate action and gives the bearer the benefits of <i>feather fall</i> and <i>invisibility</i>. The duration of the two effects work independently; ending one early does not affect the other. The item cannot be activated to provide just one of these two effects; they are always activated simultaneously.</p>",
