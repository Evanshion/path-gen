The staff is crafted from platinum and topped with a glowing blue diamond. The staff allows the use of the following spells:</p><ul><li><i>Bless </i>(1 charge)</li><li><i>Cure moderate wounds</i> (1 charge)</li><li><i>Freedom of movement </i>(1 charge)</li><li><i>Hold person</i> (heightened to 5th level, 1 charge)</li><li><i>Prayer</i> (1 charge)</li><li><i>Searing light</i> (1 charge)</li><li><i>Cure critical wounds</i> (2 charges)</li><li><i>Flame strike</i> (2 charges)</li><li><i>Righteous might</i> (2 charges)</li><li><i>True seeing</i> (2 charges)</li></ul><p class=\"stat-block\">The wielder of a <i>staff of the hierophant </i>gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. The staff is also a <i>+2/+2 quarterstaff</i>, and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (as a free action), the staff deals double damage (&times;3 on a critical hit) for 1 round.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A <i>staff of the hierophant </i>can be used to restore the life of a dead creature by calling upon the wielder's deity to take the staff as a blessing. This causes the staff to vanish, but restores life to any one dead creature as if casting <i>true resurrection</i>. In addition, after using this effect, the wielder who triggered it receives a +2 luck bonus on all ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 day.</p>",
