    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A combination weapon, this gun mixes a coat pistol with a sword cane. The sword cane pistol is considered a double weapon for the purpose of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. The pistol attachment makes the nature of the weapon a little more difficult to hide. An observer must succeed at a DC 15 Perception check to realize that an undrawn sword cane pistol is a weapon rather than a simple walking stick; the DC decreases to 5 if the observer is able to handle the weapon. A sword cane pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. The sword part of the weapon must be drawn in order to load the pistol part of the weapon. This is an early firearm.</p>",
