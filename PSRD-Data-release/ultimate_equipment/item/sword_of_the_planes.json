The +2 enhancement bonus also applies whenever the weapon is used against creatures native to the elemental planes. It operates as a <i>+3 longsword </i>on the Astral Plane and the Ethereal Plane, or when used against opponents native to either of those planes. On any other plane, or against any outsider, it functions as a <i>+4 longsword</i>.</p>",
