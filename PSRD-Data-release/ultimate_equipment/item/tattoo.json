    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">The price of a tattoo depends on the quality, size, and number of colors used. A coin-sized tattoo in blue ink that will blur over a decade costs 1 cp, a hand-sized one in black ink that won't fade costs 1 sp, and a tattoo covering an entire back takes several sessions and costs 10 gp. Each additional color costs as much as a single tattoo of its size. While these prices represent the baseline, tattoos&mdash;like any other artwork&mdash;can be worth far more depending on the prestige of the artist.</p>",
