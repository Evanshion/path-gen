A <i>thawing </i>weapon thrust into a nonmagical frozen object of Medium size or smaller melts the ice from it. When used against a creature with the cold subtype, it deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. The wielder of a <i>thawing </i>weapon receives a +2 competence bonus on saving throws against ice-based effects, and the weapon itself is immune to cold damage. </p>",
