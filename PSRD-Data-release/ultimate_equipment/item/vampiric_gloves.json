    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">These pale, elegant-looking leather gloves have blood-red stitching on the fingers&mdash;which bears a startling resemblance to blood-encrusted fingernails. Three times per day, the wearer can use <i>vampiric touch</i> and <i>bleed</i>. If the wearer uses <i>vampiric touch</i> and holds the charge, the charge dissipates if the gloves are removed.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Though <i>vampiric touch</i> is normally a touch attack, the wearer may instead use that ability as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet, but only against a dying target or a target suffering from a bleed effect. When using <i>vampiric touch</i> in this way, the wearer may hold the charge on a missed ranged touch attack.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If the wearer is suffering from a bleed effect, he may expend one use of <i>vampiric touch</i> to end the bleed effect.</p>",
