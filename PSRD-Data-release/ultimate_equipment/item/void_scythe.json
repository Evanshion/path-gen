    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Instead of a blade, a swathe of absolute darkness inimical to life tips this scythe. It functions as a <i>+1 brilliant-energy scythe</i>, except the blade is formed of negative energy and gives off no light whatsoever. The wielder can channel negative energy directly into the scythe to charge it with life-destroying energy for 1 round per die of channeling. For example, channeling negative energy for 5d6 points of damage fuels the scythe for 5 rounds. While so charged, the <i>void scythe</i> bestows one negative level with each hit. One day after being struck, subjects must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level or the negative levels become permanent.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Black energy utterly consumes any creature that is slain by the <i>void scythe</i>, leaving no body behind but leaving the creature's equipment unharmed. A victim of the <i>void scythe</i> can be restored only by <i>true resurrection</i> or carefully worded <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i>.</p>",
