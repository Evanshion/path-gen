    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This musket has a warhammer head at the end of its barrel, which allows it to be used as both a musket and a warhammer. It is considered a double weapon for the purposes of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. If this firearm gains the broken condition, both the firearm component and the warhammer are considered broken. A warhammer musket uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>",
