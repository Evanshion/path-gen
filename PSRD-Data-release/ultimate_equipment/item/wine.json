    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Wine is made from fermented fruit juice, usually grapes, but also sometimes berries, apples, or even rice (sake). The lower listed price is for unremarkable common wine and the higher is for significantly finer wine, though wine from certain vintners (and specific years) may fetch much higher prices. In colder climates, wine is often mulled with fruit, spices, honey, and almonds and served as a warming beverage during the winter.</p>",
