    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A <i>wounding</i> weapon deals 1 point of bleed damage when it hits a creature. Multiple hits from a <i>wounding</i> weapon increase the bleed damage. Bleeding creatures take the bleed damage at the start of their turns. Bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal check or through the application of any spell that cures hit point damage. A critical hit does not multiply the bleed damage. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the bleed damage dealt by this weapon.</p>",
