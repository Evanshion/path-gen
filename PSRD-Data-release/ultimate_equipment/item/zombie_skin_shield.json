Once per day, the wearer can animate the skin as a human zombie under her control, as if she had created it with <i>animate dead</i>, for a period of 5 minutes. When the time expires, the zombie returns to the shield. If the zombie is destroyed or cannot reach the shield by the time it expires, placing the shield on a Medium humanoid corpse for 1 hour recreates the shield's skin.</p>",
