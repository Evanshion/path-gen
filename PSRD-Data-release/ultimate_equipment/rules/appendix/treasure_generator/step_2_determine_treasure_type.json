    "body": "<p>To determine the type of treasures gained from an encounter, examine the types of creatures in the encounter and the general setting of the encounter. The types of treasure garnered from encounters can vary wildly depending on the types of creatures encountered. For example, the treasure found in the lair of a troll (remnants of its previous meals, no doubt) is sure to be different than the treasure found in the burial crypt of an ancient mummy. While the troll's treasure might contain coins and small objects such as potions or rings, the mummy's crypt might hold gems, art objects, and ancient magic items. Even if these types of treasures are worth approximately the same value, their exact composition is different.</p><p>The following section looks at each creature type individually and describes what treasures a particular type usually has. Each creature type lists a number of different treasure types, denoted by letters, which are described in detail in Step 3. Not every creature of each type will follow these guidelines, so weigh each carefully before deciding what treasure type best fits the creature. Note that a creature typically has treasure of only one type, but in some circumstances it might fit the encounter to have treasures of multiple different types as part of the reward.</p>",
