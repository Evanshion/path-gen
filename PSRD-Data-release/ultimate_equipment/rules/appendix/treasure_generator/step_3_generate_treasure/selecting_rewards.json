    "body": "<p>The GM should take care in deciding what rewards to give the PCs. In most cases, the GM should settle for the largest reward her budget allows, filling any excess budget with lesser rewards and coins (usually type A treasure). This gives the PCs a chance to get some of the more powerful magic items that are appropriate for their level. Selecting a larger number of smaller rewards grants a larger number of items, but they will be of comparatively lesser value in terms of usefulness.</p>",
