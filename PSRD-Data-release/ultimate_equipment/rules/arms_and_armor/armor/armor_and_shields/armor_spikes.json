    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">You can have spikes added to your armor, which allow you to deal extra piercing damage on a successful grapple attack (see \"spiked armor\" in the Martial Weapons Table). The spikes count as a martial weapon. If you are not proficient with them, you take a &ndash;4 penalty on grapple checks when you try to use them. You can also make a regular melee attack (or off-hand attack) with the spikes, and they count as a light weapon in this case. (You can't also make an attack with armor spikes if you have already made an attack with another off-hand weapon, and vice versa.) An enhancement bonus to a suit of armor does not improve the spikes' effectiveness, but the spikes can be made into magic weapons in their own right.</p>",
