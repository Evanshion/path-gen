If you are proficient with the madu, you may use it to fight defensively with a &ndash;2 penalty instead of the normal &ndash;4, and your attack penalty for using Combat Expertise improves by +1 (minimum &ndash;1 penalty). You cannot hold anything else in the hand that bears a madu. If you are not proficient with the madu, treat it as a light spiked shield. A madu can't be disarmed. While traditional madus are crafted from leather and animal horn, they can be made entirely out of metal. Whether leather or steel, a madu offers the same basic protection and attack benefits, though the two varieties respond differently to some spells and effects (such as <i>rusting grasp</i>). A druid can use a leather madu, but not a steel madu. </p>",
