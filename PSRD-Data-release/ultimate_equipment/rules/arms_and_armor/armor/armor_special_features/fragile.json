    "body": "<p>Armor with the fragile quality falls apart when hit with heavy blows. if an attacker hits a creature wearing fragile armor with an attack roll of a natural 20 and confirms the critical hit (even if the creature is immune to critical hits), the armor gains the broken condition. if already broken, the armor is destroyed instead. Fragile armor is broken or destroyed by only critical threats that are generated by natural 20s. </p><p>Masterwork and magical fragile armor lacks these flaws unless otherwise noted in the item description or the special material description.</p><p>If armor gains the broken condition in this way, that armor is considered to have taken damage equal to half its hit points +1. This damage is repaired either by something that addresses the effect that granted the armor the broken condition (like the Field Repair feat) or the repair methods described in the broken condition. When an effect that grants the broken condition is removed, the armor regains the hit points it lost when the broken condition was applied. Damage done by an attack against armor (such as from a sunder combat maneuver) cannot be repaired by an effect that removes the broken condition.</p>",
