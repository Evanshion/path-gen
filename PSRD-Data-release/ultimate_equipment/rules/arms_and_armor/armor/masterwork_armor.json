Such a well-made item functions like the normal version, except that its armor check penalty is lessened by 1.</p><p>The <i>masterwork transformation</i> spell transforms a non-masterwork weapon into a masterwork weapon. Without using magic, you can't add the masterwork quality to armor or a shield after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork item (see the Craft skill). </p><p>A masterwork suit of armor or shield costs an extra 150 gp over and above the normal price for that type of armor or shield.</p><p>The masterwork quality of a suit of armor or shield never provides a bonus on attack or damage rolls, even if the armor or shield is used as a weapon.</p><p>All magic armors and shields are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality.</p><p>Even though some types of armor and shields can be used as weapons, you can't create a masterwork version of such an item that confers an enhancement bonus on attack rolls. However, you can create masterwork armor spikes and shield spikes, which do confer their enhancement bonus on attack rolls to attacks made with the spikes.</p>",
