    "body": "<p>The armor and Armor Class system is an abstraction where an attack roll that \"misses\" represents actual misses as well as attacks that fail to hit the target hard or accurately enough to cause harm. Some players and GMs may prefer a different system where a failed attack roll is an actual miss, and armor absorbs points of damage from successful attacks.</p><p>A variant set of rules for this game mechanic is presented in <i>Ultimate Combat</i>. In this system, a creature has a defense score instead of an armor class (representing how easy or difficult it is to hit a creature), and the armor's armor class value indicates how many points of dr it grants against incoming attacks. This increases the bookkeeping burden for creatures with armor, but may give more satisfying results.</p>",
