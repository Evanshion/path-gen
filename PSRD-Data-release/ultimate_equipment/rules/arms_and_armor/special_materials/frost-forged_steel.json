    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This material is the same substance as fire-forged steel with a subtle difference in the alignment of the metal during crafting. Instead of channeling heat away from the wearer, it channels heat toward the wearer. Frost-forged steel works similarly to fire-forged steel, except its effects apply to cold damage rather than fire damage. This means frost-forged steel weapons are less useful than their fire-forged counterparts, as there are few nonmagical sources of cold that can quickly imbue it with enough cold energy to deal bonus damage.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Armor and weapons made from frost-forged steel are always considered masterwork, and the masterwork costs are included in the listed prices.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Frost-forged steel has the same hit points and hardness as steel. Frost-forged steel costs the same as fire-forged steel.</p>",
