From rocks lashed to wooden hafts to create early maces and axes, to flint knives and stone arrowheads, these primitive weapons are still deadly.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Stone weapons cost a quarter as much as base items of their type, and weigh 75% of what base items of their type do.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Light and one-handed bludgeoning weapons, spears, and arrowheads can all be made of stone.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Weapons made of stone have half the hardness of their base weapons, and have the fragile condition. With a few exceptions (such as stoneplate), armor cannot usually be constructed from stone. Magically strengthened stone does not have the fragile quality.</p>",
