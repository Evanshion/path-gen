Whipwood is actually a composite of several bendable wooden fibers woven and fused together to form a flexible but sturdy unit. Only wooden weapons or weapons with wooden hafts (such as axes and spears) can be made out of whipwood. A creature wielding a whipwood weapon gains a +2 bonus to its CMD when defending against sunder attempts against the weapon. A whipwood weapon's hit points increase by +5. Whipwood loses its special qualities if under the effect of an <i>ironwood</i> spell. Whipwood weapons cost 500 gp more than normal weapons of their type.</p>",
