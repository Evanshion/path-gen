    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">The root of the wyrwood tree has a peculiar quality. When a weapon constructed of wyroot confirms a critical hit, it absorbs some of the life force of the creature struck. The struck creature is unharmed and the wyroot weapon gains 1 life point. As a swift action, a wielder with a <i>ki </i>pool or an arcane pool can absorb 1 life point from the wyrwood weapon and convert it into either 1 <i>ki</i> point or 1 arcane pool point. Most wyroot weapons can only hold 1 life point at a time, but higher-quality wyroot does exist. The most powerful wyroot weapons can hold up to 3 life points at a time. Any unspent life points dissipate at dusk. </p><p class=\"stat-block\">Wyroot can be used to construct any melee weapon made entirely of wood or a melee weapon with a wooden haft. Constructing a wyroot weapon that can hold 1 life point increases the weapon's price by 1,000 gp, constructing one that can hold up to 2 life points increases the weapon's price by 2,000 gp, and constructing one that can hold up to 3 life points increases the weapon's price by 4,000 gp.</p>",
