When your character scores a critical hit, roll the damage two, three, or four times, as indicated by its critical multiplier (using all applicable modifiers on each roll), and add all the results together.</p><p>Extra damage over and above a weapon's normal damage (such as sneak attack damage or bonus damage from the flaming weapon quality) is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.</p><blockquote><p><i>&times;2</i>The weapon deals double damage on a critical hit. Some weapons deal triple or quadruple damage.</p><p><i>&times;2/&times;3</i>: One head of this double weapon deals double damage on a critical hit. The other head deals triple damage. Some double weapons' heads deal triple and quadruple damage on a critical hit.</p><p><i>19&ndash;20/&times;2</i>: The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit. Some weapons score a threat on a natural 18 as well, or deal triple instead of double damage on a critical hit.</p></blockquote>",
