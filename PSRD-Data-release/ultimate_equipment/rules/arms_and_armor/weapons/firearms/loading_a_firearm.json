In the case of two-handed firearms, you hold the weapon in one hand and load it with the other&mdash;you only need to hold it in two hands to aim and shoot the firearm.</p><p>The Rapid Reload feat reduces the time required to load one-handed and two-handed firearms. Loading any firearm provokes attacks of opportunity. Other rules for loading a firearm depend on whether the firearm is an early firearm or an advanced firearm.</p><blockquote><p><i>Early Firearms:</i> Early firearms are all muzzle-loaded, requiring bullets or pellets and black powder to be rammed down the muzzle. If an early firearm has multiple barrels, each barrel must be loaded separately. It is a standard action to load each barrel of a one-handed early firearm and a full-round action to load each barrel of a two-handed early firearm.</p><p><i>Advanced Firearms:</i> Advanced firearms are chamber-loaded. It is a move action to load a one-handed or two-handed advanced firearm to its full capacity.</p></blockquote>",
