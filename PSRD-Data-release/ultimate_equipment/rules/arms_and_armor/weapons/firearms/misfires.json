    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">If the natural result of your attack roll with a firearm is equal to or less than the firearm's misfire value, that shot misses, even if you would have otherwise hit the target. When a firearm misfires, it gains the broken condition. While it has the broken condition, it suffers the normal disadvantages that broken weapons do, and its misfire value increases by 4 unless the wielder has gun training in the particular type of firearm. In that case, the misfire value increases by 2 instead of 4.</p><blockquote><p><i>Early Firearms:</i> If an early firearm with the broken condition misfires again, it explodes. When a nonmagical firearm explodes, the weapon is destroyed. Magical firearms are wrecked, which means they can't fire until they are fully restored (which requires either the make whole spell or the Gunsmithing feat). When a gun explodes, pick one corner of your square&mdash;the explosion creates a burst from that point of origin. Each early firearm has a burst size noted in parentheses after its misfire value. Any creature within this burst (including the firearm's wielder) takes damage as if it had been hit by the weapon&mdash;a DC 12 Reflex save halves this damage.</p><p><i>Advanced Firearms:</i> Advanced firearms can misfire, but when they do, they only gain the broken condition. A subsequent misfire does not cause advanced firearms to explode.</p></blockquote>",
