    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This pistol has six barrels instead of one. The entire barrel housing can be quickly rotated by hand between shots (a free action requiring one free hand), allowing all six bullets to be fired before the weapon must be reloaded. Each barrel of a pepperbox uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.</p>",
