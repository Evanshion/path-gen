At higher range increments, the attack resolves normally, including taking the normal cumulative &ndash;2 penalty for each full range increment. Unlike other projectile weapons, early firearms have a maximum range of five range increments.</p><p><i>Advanced Firearms:</i> Advanced firearms resolve their attacks against touch AC when the target is within the first five range increments, but this type of attack is not considered a touch attack for the purposes of feats such as Deadly Aim. At higher range increments, the attack resolves normally, including taking the normal cumulative &ndash;2 penalty for each full-range increment.
