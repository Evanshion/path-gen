    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A light flail consists of a weighted striking end connected to a handle by a sturdy chain. Though often imagined as a ball, sometimes spiked like the head of a morningstar, the head of a light flail can actually take many different shapes, such as short bars. Military flails are sturdier evolutions of agricultural flails, which are used for threshing&mdash;beating stacks of grains to separate the useful grains from their husks.</p>",
