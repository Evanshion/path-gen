Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The character with a <i>deck of many things </i>who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. If the Idiot or Jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw additional cards.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the Jester or the Fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A <i>deck of many things </i>contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are clarified below.</p>",

Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void and utterly destroyed. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A <i>sphere of annihilation</i> is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of <i>telekinesis</i>, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character's ability to gain control of a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Intelligence modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere's speed in a round is 10 feet + 5 feet for every 5 points by which the character's control check result in that round exceeded 30.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it. If two or more creatures vie for control of a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, the rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who rolled lowest.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">See also <i>talisman of the sphere</i>. </p>",

During the day, half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. At night, the device focuses distant starlight, and the maximum damage is only 10d6, although the lens does not function at all for 1 hour before sunrise and 1 hour after sunset.

The user can alter both the damage (up to the maximum for the current lighting conditions) and the orbit in any direction, but the lens must move 20 feet each round, and cannot travel more than 3 miles from the temple in any direction before it curves back around and begins returning. Only divine intervention or powerful magic like <i>wish </i>or <i>miracle</i> can overcome this limited range, making a new person or place the center of the lens's orbit.</p>",

Atop the massive storm cloud, the castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers and barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that can hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts. In all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 Medium creatures. </p><p class=\"stat-block\">In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be at least 17th level, and must have the Leadership feat and 17 ranks in Knowledge (arcana). If the castle already has a master, that master must be defeated before another can take her place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying device for the castle's master, though it can view only places inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she designates) can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the Fly skill modifier of the person controlling its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a Fly check and never risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves randomly, sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It has the ability to travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm King is known to have invoked this power. The master of the castle gains the following spell-like abilities.</p><ul><li>Call lightning storm 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber or one of the towers to use this ability.</li><li><i>Guards and wards</i> 1/day on the central tower.</li><li><i>Storm of vengeance</i> 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber to use this ability, and the storm rains down from the castle's cloudy base upon everything within range underneath (2,200 feet).</li><li><i>Wind wall</i> at will. This effect surrounds the entire castle at a range of 100 feet, and can be raised or lowered by the master (or a creature he or she designates) from the control room or any tower as a standard action.</li></ul>",

Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying the <i>Codex </i>allows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as the <i>insanity</i> spell). The powers of the <i>Codex of the Infinite Planes </i>are as follows: <i>astral projection ,  banishment ,  elemental swarm ,  gate ,  greater planar ally ,  greater planar binding ,  plane shift , </i>and <i>soul bind . </i>Each of these spell-like abilities are usable at will by the owner of the <i>Codex </i>(assuming that he or she has learned how to access the power). The <i>Codex of the Infinite Planes </i>has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can't take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates that a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). A character can incur only one catastrophe per power use. </p>",

An item's purpose must suit the type and alignment of the item. A magic item with a purpose should be treated as an individual with a goal, not a fanatical parody. For example, a purpose of \"defeat/slay arcane spellcasters\" doesn't mean that an intelligent  sword forces the wielder to kill every wizard she sees. Nor does it mean that the sword believes it is possible to kill every wizard, sorcerer, and bard in the world. It does mean that the item hates arcane spellcasters and wants to bring an end to the rule of a sorcerer-queen in a nearby land. Likewise, a purpose of \"defend elves\" doesn't mean that if the wielder is an elf, he only wants to help the wielder. It means that the item wants to be used in furthering the cause of elves, stamping out their enemies and aiding their leaders. A purpose of \"defeat/slay all\" isn't just a matter of self-preservation. It means that the item won't rest (or let its wielder rest) until it places itself above all others. </p><p>The table below has a number of sample purposes that a magic item might possess. If the wielder specifically ignores or goes against an intelligent item's special purpose, the item gains a +4 bonus to its Ego until the wielder cooperates.

Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or higher always considers itself superior to any character, and a personality conflict results if the possessor does not always agree with the item.</p><p>When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a Will saving throw (DC = the item's Ego). If the possessor succeeds, she is dominant. If she fails, the item is dominant. Dominance lasts for 1 day or until a critical situation occurs (such as a major battle, a serious threat to either the item or the character, and so on, as determined by the GM). Should an item gain dominance, it resists the character's desires and demands concessions such as any of the following:</p><ul><li>Removal of associates or items whose alignment or personality is distasteful to the item.</li><li>The character divesting herself of all other magic items or items of a certain type.</li><li>Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go for its own purposes.</li><li>Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item.</li><li>Magical protections and devices to safeguard the item from molestation when it is not in use.</li><li>That the character carry the item with her on all occasions.</li><li>That the character relinquish the item to a more suitable possessor due to alignment differences or conduct.</li></ul><p>In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures, such as the following:</p><ul><li>Force its possessor into combat.</li><li>Refuse to strike opponents.</li><li>Strike at its wielder or her associates.</li><li>Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.</li><li>Cause itself to drop from the character's grasp.</li></ul><p>Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns between the character's and item's alignments or when their purposes and personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might wish to have a lesser character possess it in order to easily establish and maintain dominance over him, or a higher-level possessor so as to better accomplish its goals.</p><p>All magic items with personalities desire to play an important role in whatever activity is under way, particularly combat. Such items are natural rivals, even with others of the same alignment. No intelligent item wants to share its wielder with other intelligent magic items. An intelligent item is aware of the presence of any other intelligent item within 60 feet, and such an intelligent item usually tries its best to mislead or distract its host so that she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course, alignment might change this sort of behavior. </p><p>Items with personalities are never totally controlled or silenced by the characters that possess them, even though they might never successfully control their possessors. They might be powerless to force their demands, but most remain undaunted and continue to air their wishes and preferences.</p>",

The rod grants the wielder a +2 competence bonus on three Knowledge skills; these skills are determined when the rod is created (and require the apprentice to have ranks in that skill) and can never be changed. Knowledge (arcana) is almost always one of these three skills. </p><p class=\"stat-block\">A typical rod of this type is lawful neutral, though rods with other alignments exist.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If a <i>metamagician's apprentice</i> becomes dominant after a personality conflict, it insists the wearer find a way to free its mind from the object or destroy the item so its mind can be at peace.</p>",
