    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">The <i>Codex</i> is enormous&mdash;supposedly, it requires two strong men to lift it. No matter how many pages are turned, another always remains. Anyone opening the <i>Codex </i>for the first time is utterly annihilated, as with a <i>destruction</i> spell (Fortitude DC 30). Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying the <i>Codex </i>allows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as the <i>insanity</i> spell). The powers of the <i>Codex of the Infinite Planes </i>are as follows: <i>astral projection ,  banishment ,  elemental swarm ,  gate ,  greater planar ally ,  greater planar binding ,  plane shift , </i>and <i>soul bind . </i>Each of these spell-like abilities are usable at will by the owner of the <i>Codex </i>(assuming that he or she has learned how to access the power). The <i>Codex of the Infinite Planes </i>has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can't take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates that a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). A character can incur only one catastrophe per power use. </p>",
