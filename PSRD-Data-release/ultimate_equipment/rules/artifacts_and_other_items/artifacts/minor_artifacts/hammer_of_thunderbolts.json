In the hands of a wielder who wears a <i>belt of giant strength</i> and knows the weapon is a <i>hammer of thunderbolts</i> (not just the <i>+3 warhammer</i> it appears to be), it becomes a <i>+5 Large giant-bane returning thundering warhammer</i> with the following two properties. One, when the bearer hits with the hammer as a thrown attack, it emits a powerful clap of thunder, causing all creatures within 90 feet to be stunned for 1 round (DC 15 Fortitude negates); the wielder is not immune to this effect. Two, the hammer's range increment increases to 30 feet.</p>",
