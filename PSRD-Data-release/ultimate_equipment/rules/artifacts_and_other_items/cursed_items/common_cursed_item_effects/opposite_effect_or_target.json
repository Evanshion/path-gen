    "body": "<p>These cursed items malfunction so that they either do the opposite of what the creator intended or target the user instead of someone else. The interesting point to keep in mind here is that these items aren't always bad to have&mdash;some have powerful applications once the effect is fully understood. Opposite-effect items include weapons that impose penalties on attack and damage rolls rather than bonuses. Just as a character shouldn't necessarily immediately know what the enhancement bonus of a noncursed magic item is, she shouldn't immediately know that a weapon is cursed. Once she knows, however, the item can be discarded unless it possesses some ability that compels the wielder to keep and use it. In such cases, a <i>remove curse</i> spell is generally needed to get rid of the item.</p>",
