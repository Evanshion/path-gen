    "body": "<p>While some cursed items can simply be discarded, others force a compulsion upon the user to keep the item, no matter the costs. Others reappear even if discarded or are impossible to throw away. These items can only be discarded after the character or item is targeted by a <i>remove curse</i> spell or similar magic. the dc of the caster level check to undo the curse is equal to 10 + the cursed item's caster level. if the spell is successful, the item can be discarded on the following round, but the curse reasserts itself if the item is used again.</p>",
