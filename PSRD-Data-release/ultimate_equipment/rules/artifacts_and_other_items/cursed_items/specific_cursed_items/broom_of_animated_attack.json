    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This item is indistinguishable from a normal broom. It is identical to a <i>broom of flying</i> by all tests short of attempted use.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If a creature attempts to fly using the broom, the broom does a loop-the-loop with its hopeful rider, dumping him on his head from 1d4+5 feet off the ground (no falling damage, since the fall is less than 10 feet). The broom then attacks the victim, swatting his face with the straw or twig end and beating him with the handle end. The broom gets two attacks per round with each end (two swats with the straw and two with the handle, for a total of four attacks per round). It attacks with a +5 bonus on each attack roll. The straw end causes a victim to be <span class=\"hyperlink-1\">blinded for 1 round when it hits. The handle deals 1d6 points of damage when it hits. The broom has <span class=\"hyperlink-1\">AC 13, <span class=\"hyperlink-1\">CMD 17, 18 hit points, and hardness 4. </span></span></span></p>",
