    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This blade seems to be and behaves in all ways as a <i>sword of subtlety</i> until actually used in combat. Once used in combat, it imposes a &ndash;10 penalty on all Stealth checks made by its wielder. It also makes it nearly impossible for the owner to tell a lie or engage in any other sort of subterfuge. Each time he does so, he must make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid blurting out the truth or taking some other involuntary action that spoils his attempted ruse. Only curse-ending magic can rid the wielder of the sword once its curse activates.</p>",
