    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This fine silver circlet is often set with a milky moonstone. When a wearer places it on his head, the stone quickly goes dark like the waning moon, and the wearer must make a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or immediately go blind. The saving throw must be made each round that the crown is worn until the wearer succumbs to the blindness. Removing the circlet requires breaking the curse. In addition to a <i>remove curse</i> spell or similar effect, <i>remove blindness/deafness</i> can be used to end the circlet's curse long enough to remove the item.</p>",
