    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">When placed upon the head, this item's curse immediately takes effect (<span class=\"hyperlink-1\">Will DC 15 negates). On a failed save, the alignment of the wearer is radically altered to an alignment as different as possible from the former alignment&mdash;good to evil, chaotic to lawful, neutral to some extreme commitment (LE, LG, CE, or CG). Alteration in alignment is mental as well as moral, and the individual changed by the magic thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. A character who succeeds on his save can continue to wear the helmet without suffering the effect of the curse, but if he takes it off and later puts it on again, another save is required. </span></p><p class=\"stat-block\">Only a <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i> can restore a character's former alignment, and the affected individual does not make any attempt to return to the former alignment. In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible. If a character of a class with an alignment requirement is affected, an <i>atonement</i> spell is needed as well if the curse is to be obliterated. When a <i>helm of opposite alignment</i> has functioned once, it loses its magical properties. </p>",
