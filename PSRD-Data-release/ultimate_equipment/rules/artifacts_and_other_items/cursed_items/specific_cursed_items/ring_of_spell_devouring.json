Each time the wearer casts an arcane spell, he suffers a 25% spell failure chance. Furthermore, the wearer of the ring takes a &ndash;4 penalty on Spellcraft checks to identify a spell when attempting to counterspell. The ring can only be removed by a <i>remove curse</i> spell or a similar effect. </p>",
