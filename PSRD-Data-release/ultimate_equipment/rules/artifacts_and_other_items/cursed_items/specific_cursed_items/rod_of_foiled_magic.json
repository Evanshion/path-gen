    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This rod is similar in appearance to a <i>metamagic rod</i>. Once a creature picks up such a rod, it cannot be discarded without use of a <i>remove curse</i> spell or similar magic. Each time the wielder casts a spell, he takes the <i>rod of foiled magic</i> in hand and treats the caster level of the spell as 2 levels lower. If this would reduce the caster level to 0 or lower, than the caster has only a 50% chance of casting the spell (any chance of arcane spell failure is added to this percentile chance), but if he is able to cast the spell, the spell has a caster level of 1st. </p>",
