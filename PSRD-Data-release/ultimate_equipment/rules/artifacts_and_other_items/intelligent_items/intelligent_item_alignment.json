If you're generating a random intelligent weapon, that weapon's alignment must fit with any alignment-oriented special abilities it has.</p><p>Any character whose alignment does not correspond to that of the item (except as noted by the asterisks on the table below) gains one negative level if he so much as picks up the item. Although this negative level never results in actual level loss, it remains as long as the item is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells). this negative level is cumulative with any other penalties the item might place on inappropriate wielders. items with ego scores of 20 to 29 bestow two negative levels. items with ego scores of 30 or higher bestow three negative levels.</p>",
