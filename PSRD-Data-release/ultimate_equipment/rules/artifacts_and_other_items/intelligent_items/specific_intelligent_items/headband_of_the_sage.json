This intellect can be of any alignment and its only purpose is to share its vast knowledge with its wearer. The headband also functions as a <i>helm of comprehend languages and read magic.</i>  Furthermore, instead of granting the normal skill ranks of a <i>headband of vast intellect +6</i>, this headband grants 4 ranks in six skills, but all of those skills must be Knowledge skills. It grants such intelligence by a stream of constant whispers and arguments that the headband communicates telepathically in Common or in one of 10 other languages it knows. Once per week on command, the wearer can also convince the headband to use <i>legend lore</i> as the spell, though the casting time is only a standard action. </p>",
