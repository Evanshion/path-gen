    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This <i>+2 keen dancing longsword</i> is infused with the soul of a bard who chose to instill his consciousness into a weapon rather than to see his voice die. The sword constantly sings. The only way to silence it to a whisper is with a DC 15 Diplomacy or Intimidate check, and even this only quiets the sword for 10 minutes plus another 10 minutes for every 5 points by which the DC is exceeded. The sword speaks, though it typically communicates through song. A <i>singing sword</i> has the following powers. </p><ul><li>Eight times per day, a <i>singing sword</i> can use bardic performance, but can only use the countersong, distraction, fascinate, inspire courage, or inspire competence abilities. The sword is treated as an 8th-level bard for the purposes of these abilities.</li><li>Three times per day, the <i>singing sword</i> can use the <i>heroic finale</i> spell.</li></ul>",
