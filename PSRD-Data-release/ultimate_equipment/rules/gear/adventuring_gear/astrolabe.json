    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This device consists of a flat disc upon which two other discs are mounted. The mounted discs can rotate on a central axis, allowing them to spin and move as days pass. The bottom disc represents the latitude of the user; an astrolabe is useless if the user is outside the preset latitude. The upper disc represents the sky, and is filled with astronomical features. Anyone can be shown how to use an astrolabe at night to determine the date and time (which takes 1 minute). When using an astrolabe, you can make a Survival check using your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier to avoid becoming lost. </p>",
