It includes a <i>potion of cure moderate wounds</i>, oil of bless weapon (1 application), a longspear, a backpack, three large sacks, a sunrod, a tower shield, and 5 vials of alchemist's fire. For hunting dragons that are immune to fire, the alchemist's fire can be replaced with acid at the time of purchase, for a savings of 50 gp.</p>",
