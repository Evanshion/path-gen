    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">When you apply this thin gel to your skin, armor, or clothing, it creates a resistant barrier that protects you from cold damage. You gain cold resistance 5. The gel flakes away as it absorbs cold damage; when it absorbs a total of 20 points of cold damage, it is discharged. Frost ward gel counts as <i>protection from energy</i> for the purpose of stacking multiple cold protection effects. Applying frost ward gel takes 1 minute, and it lasts for 1 hour before losing its potency. Multiple applications of frost ward gel do not stack; applying more while a dose is active merely resets the potential amount of cold damage absorbed to 20 points.</p>",
