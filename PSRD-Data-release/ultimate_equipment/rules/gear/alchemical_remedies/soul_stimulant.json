If you have a negative level (whether temporary or permanent), you can drink a dose of soul stimulant, negating the negative level's penalty for 12 hours. You can only benefit from 1 dose of soul stimulant at a time, though you can continue to take a dose every 12 hours to stave off the negative level's effects.</p>",
