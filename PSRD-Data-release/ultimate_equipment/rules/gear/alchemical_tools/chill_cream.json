Spreading a dose on your face and hands takes a full-round action and grants you a +2 alchemical bonus on saves to resist hot weather. In areas of bright light this bonus increases to +4, while in areas of dim light or darkness it is negated. A dose of chill cream lasts for 1 hour after being applied. A newly crafted bottle of chill cream holds 5 doses.</p>",
