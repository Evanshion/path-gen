    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface (a move action). Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with tinder and a flint and steel or magnifying glass. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a standard action rather than a full-round action, and lighting any other fire with one is at least a standard action. A tindertwig burns for 1d2 rounds and sheds light as a candle. Tindertwigs are waterproof, but must be dried before you can strike them.</p>",
