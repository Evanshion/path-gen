By holding the tube, you can then use the crystalline blade as if it were a Medium short sword with the fragile quality (see page 22). The blade lasts for 10 minutes, after which it evaporates, leaving nothing behind but the tube. You can add one dose of poison to the liquid in the bottle, which acts like applying a dose of poison to a weapon except it is a full-round action; when the liquid turns into a solid blade, the weapon includes one application of that poison. When the blade evaporates, the poison does so as well. Crafting a liquid blade is a DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check.</p>",
