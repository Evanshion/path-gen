    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This one-piece suit of clothing reduces one's drag in the water, making swimming easier. It provides a +1 circumstance bonus on Swim checks. The suit only grants this bonus if it is the outermost garment, and has no effect if worn over bulky clothes or armor or with cumbersome gear (such as a backpack, large weapons, and so on). Damage to the suit (such as from several rounds of combat against slashing and piercing attacks) negates the suit's bonus until it is repaired.</p>",
