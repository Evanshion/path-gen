It is made by soaking a poisonous toad or frog (or its eggs) in weak beer, or by &ldquo;milking&rdquo; these animals for their poison and mixing it with the beer (which allows the animal to be used over and over again). Some tribes use wide-mouthed jugs and leave the dead animal inside as a crunchy treat for eating once the drink is gone. A creature drunk on bufo has the dazzled condition in addition to the normal intoxication effect.</p>",
