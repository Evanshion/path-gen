    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This dish is a meaty pudding made of sheep organs (mainly heart, liver, and lungs) minced with onion, oats, fat, spices, and salt, wrapped in a sheep stomach and slow-cooked. Though its ingredients discourage cautious eaters, fans of haggis consider it a hearty meal with a wonderful texture. It is usually served with turnips, potatoes, and whiskey.</p>",
