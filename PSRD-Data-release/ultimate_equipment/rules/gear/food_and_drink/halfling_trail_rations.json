Common foods include sweetened dried fruit, aged sausage, hard sharp cheese, honey cakes, and a mixture of roasted grains, nuts, and molasses. If you are a halfling who subsists on nothing but these rations for at least 1 week, you reduce the penalty for the shaken condition from &ndash;2 to &ndash;1. This benefit lasts until you eat a meal other than the rations or go for a full day without eating a day's worth.</p>",
