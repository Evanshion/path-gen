    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A cold bath usually involves someone else's used soapy bath water. A hot bath is a one-person washtub filled with hot water one pot at a time. A public bath is a bath facility (such as a bath house or resort) that provides hot water, soap, and cologne or perfume, and may also offer wading pools, massages, or other services for an additional cost. Some public baths require membership or a minimum social status.</p>",
