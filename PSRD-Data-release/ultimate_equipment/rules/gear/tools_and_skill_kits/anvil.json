    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">While anvil sizes vary depending on the type of smithing for which they are used, all anvils have the same basic shape and construction. Blacksmith anvils are much heavier and larger (100 pounds) than farrier anvils (50 pounds), which in turn are much bigger than silver- or goldsmith anvils (10 pounds). Many metalworking tasks are impossible without the proper anvil.</p>",
