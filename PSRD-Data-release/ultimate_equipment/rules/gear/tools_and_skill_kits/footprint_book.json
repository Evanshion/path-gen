    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This 50-page tome contains accurate drawings of common animal, humanoid, and monster tracks, as well as notes on stride length, tread depth, and similarly useful information. The book gives you a +2 circumstance bonus to identify a creature by its tracks, though the use of shoes makes identifying many humanoids difficult or impossible. Though the book can't help you identify unique individuals, it can help you tell an ogre's footprint from a troll's footprint, or an elf's track from an orc's. Books sold in different areas may have different footprints, depending on what creatures are common to that location. </p>",
