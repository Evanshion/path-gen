Once per day on command, the wearer can invoke an effect, as per the spell <i>righteous might</i>, lasting for 10 rounds. <i>Righteous</i> armor is always aligned toward good (positive energy), for the effects of <i>righteous might</i>. <i>Righteous</i> armor bestows one permanent negative level on any evil creature attempting to wear it. The negative level remains as long as the armor is worn and disappears when it is removed. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by <i>restoration</i> spells) while the armor is worn.</p>",
