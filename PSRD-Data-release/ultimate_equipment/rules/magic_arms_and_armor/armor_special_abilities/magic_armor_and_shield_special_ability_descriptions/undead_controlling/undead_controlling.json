They let the user control up to 26 Hit Dice of undead per day, as the <i>control undead</i> spell. At dawn each day, the wearer loses control of any undead still under his sway. Armor or a shield with this ability appears to be made of bone; this feature is entirely decorative and has no other effect on the armor.</p>",
