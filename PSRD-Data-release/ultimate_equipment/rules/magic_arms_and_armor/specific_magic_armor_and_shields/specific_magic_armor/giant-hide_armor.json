    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This drooping, many-folded suit of <i>+3 hide armor</i> is made from the tanned skin of an actual giant. Once per day on command, the wearer can grow to match the size of the appropriate giant, as if using <i>giant form I</i> (ogre, hill giant, stone giant, fire giant, frost giant, or troll) or <i>giant form II</i> (cloud giant or storm giant). This transformation lasts up to 15 minutes, and ends when the wearer commands.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Most good folk consider wearing the skins of intelligent creatures to be abhorrent. Giants gain a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against the wearer, or +4 if the wearer's armor is made from the same kind of giant as the attacker.</p>",
