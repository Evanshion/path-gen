    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This <i>+1 light wooden shield</i> has a leather strip on the back on which a spellcaster can scribe a single spell as on a scroll. A spell so scribed requires half the normal cost in raw materials. The strip cannot accommodate spells of higher than 3rd level. The strip is reusable.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A random caster's shield has a 50% chance of having a single medium scroll spell on it. The spell is divine (01&ndash;80 on d%) or arcane (81&ndash;100). A caster's shield has a 5% arcane spell failure chance. The price of the shield is modified by the value of the scroll spell if one is currently scribed.</p>",
