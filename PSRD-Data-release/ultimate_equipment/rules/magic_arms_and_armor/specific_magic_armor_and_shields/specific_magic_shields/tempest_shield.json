When used to make a shield bash attack, the shield's wielder can make a bull rush maneuver as a free action against her target without provoking an attack of opportunity from the creature being bull rushed. Once per day on command, the wielder can cause the <i>tempest shield</i> to emit a stream of high-powered air as the <i>gust of wind</i> spell.</p>",
