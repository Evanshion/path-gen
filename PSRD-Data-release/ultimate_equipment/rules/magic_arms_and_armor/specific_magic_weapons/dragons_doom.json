    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This polearm's axe blade is shaped like a snarling dragon, its maw stretched wide as it closes for the killing blow. The haft is engraved with the circling image of a dragon in flight. The head of this <i>+2 dragon bane halberd</i> glows when a creature of the dragon type is within 100 feet of the weapon. Three times per day, when the halberd hits a dragon, the wielder can have that attack ignore the dragon's DR as a free action.</p>",
