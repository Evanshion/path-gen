    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This ornately designed <i>+1 lance</i>, decorated with ribbons and small favors, allows its wielder to more effectively knock an opponent from his mount. A successful hit with a <i>lance of jousting</i> on a mounted opponent forces the target to make a Ride check (DC 10 + damage dealt) to avoid being knocked from the saddle. Although this lance is used in combat to remove a mounted foe's advantage, use of one in a tournament or similar contest is generally considered a dishonorable form of cheating.</p>",
