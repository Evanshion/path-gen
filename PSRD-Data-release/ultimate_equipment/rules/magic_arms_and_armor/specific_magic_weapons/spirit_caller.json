    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">The <i>spirit caller</i> is a <i>+1 ghost touch mere club</i> carved of nephrite jade. Incorporeal undead and ghosts struck by the <i>spirit caller</i> must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be drawn inside the mere and are trapped within it. When holding a spirit inside, the <i>spirit caller</i> glows from within with the brightness of a candle and functions as a <i>+2 ghost touch undead bane mere club</i>. The mere consumes the energy of the spirit inside in 1 hour, destroying it, and can hold but a single spirit at a time. The wielder can release a trapped spirit as a standard action. Ghosts consumed by a <i>spirit caller</i> still rejuvenate as normal.</p>",
