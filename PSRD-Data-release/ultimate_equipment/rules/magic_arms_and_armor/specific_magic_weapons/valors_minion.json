Effective on its own, a <i>valor's minion</i> is even more potent in the hands of those who dedicate their efforts to vanquishing a single foe. Whenever a wielder uses either the challenge or smite evil class feature, she can sacrifice one additional use of that class feature to treat the smite or challenge as if she were three class levels higher.</p>",
