Whenever the wielder confirms a critical hit with a <i>warbringer, </i>the wielder gains the benefits of <i>rage </i>for 1 round (if a barbarian, the wielder gains 1 additional round of rage for that day), while the creature struck is compelled to move toward and attack its nearest ally with a melee weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed strike on its next turn (DC 14 Will negates), as the <i>murderous command</i> spell.</p>",
