    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This ability can only be placed on melee weapons. Once per round, when the wielder damages a creature in melee with an <i>advancing </i>weapon, she can take a 5-foot step as a swift action after the attack but before the end of her turn. This movement does not count against her ability to move or take a 5-foot step earlier or later in the round, though using this ability imposes a &ndash;2 penalty on all attack rolls until the start of her next turn. This ability may not be used in conjunction with any other ability or effect that allows moving as part of an attack.</p>",
