The wielder must have line of sight to the intended ally. As a free action, at the start of her turn before using her weapon, the wielder chooses how to allocate her weapon's enhancement bonus. The bonus to the ally's weapon lasts until the <i>allying </i>weapon's wielder's next turn. The enhancement bonus from the <i>allying </i>weapon does not stack with the enhancement bonus on the ally's weapon (if any).</p>",
