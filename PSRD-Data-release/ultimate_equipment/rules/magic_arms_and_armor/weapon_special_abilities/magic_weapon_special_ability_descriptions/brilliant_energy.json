It always gives off light as a torch (20-foot radius). A <i>brilliant energy</i> weapon ignores nonliving matter. Armor and shield bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to that armor) do not count against it because the weapon passes through armor. (Dexterity, deflection, dodge, natural armor, and other such bonuses still apply.) A <i>brilliant energy</i> weapon cannot harm undead, constructs, or objects. </p>",
