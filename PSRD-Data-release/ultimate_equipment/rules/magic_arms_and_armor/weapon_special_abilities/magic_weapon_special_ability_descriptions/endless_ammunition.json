    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Only bows and crossbows can be made into <i>endless ammunition</i> weapons&mdash;firearms and other projectile weapons cannot. Each time an <i>endless ammunition</i> weapon is nocked, a single nonmagical arrow or bolt is spontaneously created by the magic, so the weapon's wielder never needs to load the weapon with ammunition.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If the wielder attempts to load the weapon with other ammunition, the created arrow or bolt immediately vanishes and the wielder can load the weapon as normal. This ability does not reduce the amount of time required to load or fire the weapon. The created arrow or bolt vanishes if removed from the weapon; it persists only if fired. Unlike normal bow and crossbow ammunition, these arrows and bolts are always destroyed when fired. </p>",
