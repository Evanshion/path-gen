    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A <i>ghost touch</i> weapon deals damage normally against incorporeal creatures, regardless of its bonus. An incorporeal creature's 50% reduction in damage from corporeal sources does not apply to attacks made against it with <i>ghost touch</i> weapons. The weapon can be picked up and moved by an incorporeal creature at any time. A manifesting ghost can wield the weapon against corporeal foes. Essentially, a <i>ghost touch</i> weapon counts as both corporeal or incorporeal. This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons and ammunition.</p>",
