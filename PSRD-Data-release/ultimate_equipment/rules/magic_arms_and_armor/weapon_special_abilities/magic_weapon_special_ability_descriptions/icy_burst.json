If the weapon's critical multiplier is &times;3, add an extra 2d10 points of cold damage instead, and if the multiplier is &times;4, add an extra 3d10 points.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Even if the <i>frost</i> ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra cold damage on a successful critical hit.</p>",
