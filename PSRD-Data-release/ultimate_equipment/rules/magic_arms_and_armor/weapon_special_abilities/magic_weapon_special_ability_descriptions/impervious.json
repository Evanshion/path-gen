An <i>impervious </i>weapon gains double the normal bonus to its hardness and hit points for each point of its enhancement bonus. The break DC for an <i>impervious </i>weapon and the wielder's combat maneuver defense against sunder maneuvers against the <i>impervious </i>weapon each gain a bonus equal to twice the weapon's enhancement bonus. </p>",
