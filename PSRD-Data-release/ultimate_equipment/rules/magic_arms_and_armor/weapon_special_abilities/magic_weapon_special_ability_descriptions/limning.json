On a successful strike against a creature affected by a means of magical concealment, the weapon outlines the creature in <i>faerie fire</i> (as the spell) for 1 round. Magical means of concealment include <i>blur</i>, <i>displacement</i>, <i>invisibility</i>, and similar effects, whether from a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural means, but not those provided by extraordinary abilities. A <i>liming</i> weapon has no special effect against creatures merely hiding or concealed by nonmagical means, or those hidden by environmental conditions (even magical) such as darkness or fog. </p>",
