    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A <i>negating </i>weapon briefly nullifies some forms of damage reduction when it damages a creature. Whenever a <i>negating </i>weapon damages a foe with DR/chaotic, DR/evil, DR/good, DR/lawful, or DR/magic, it reduces the value of that damage reduction by 5 points for 1 round. For example, a <i>+1 negating lance</i> hitting a creature with DR 10/good and lawful reduces the creature's DR to 5/good and lawful. If the creature has a component to its damage reduction other than the alignment types listed above, that component is unaffected. Thus, if the <i>+1 negating lance </i>above hits a demon with DR 10/good and cold iron, it would leave the demon with DR 10/cold iron and 5/good for 1 round. The effects of multiple <i>negating </i>weapons (or multiple hits from the same weapon) do not stack. This ability can only be placed on melee weapons.</p>",
