    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This special ability can only be placed on firearms. A <i>greater reliable</i> firearm is enchanted so as to be less likely to jam than other firearms. The <i>greater reliable </i>special ability reduces the misfire value of the affected firearm by 4 (minimum 0). This reduction occurs after any increases are calculated for firing with the broken condition, or for any other effect that might increase the misfire value of a firearm. A firearm with the <i>greater reliable</i> special ability cannot have the <i>reliable</i> special ability.</p>",
