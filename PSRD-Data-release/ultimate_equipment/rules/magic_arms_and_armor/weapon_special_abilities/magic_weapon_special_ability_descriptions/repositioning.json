A <i>repositioning</i> weapon grants the wielder a +2 enhancement bonus on combat maneuver checks to reposition  a foe (<i>Advanced Player's Guide</i> 322). If the wielder confirms a critical hit with the weapon, he can attempt to reposition his opponent as a free action. These reposition attempts still provoke attacks of opportunity as normal. A weapon cannot have both the <i>anchoring</i> and <i>repositioning</i> special abilities.</p>",
