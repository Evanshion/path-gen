    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A <i>spellstealing </i>weapon allows its wielder to siphon protective magic from a target and transfer it to herself. When the wielder rolls a critical threat against a target, she can forgo confirming the critical hit and instead automatically learn which spells or magical effects are active upon the target. The wielder may then make a caster level check to steal her choice of one of those effects, using the <i>spellstealing</i> weapon's caster level plus its enhancement bonus, against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the effect. If the check succeeds, the target immediately loses the benefits of that effect and the wielder gains the effect for 1 minute (or until the effect expires, whichever comes first). If the <i>spellstealing </i>weapon has a critical multiplier greater than &times;2, the wielder may attempt to steal one additional spell effect per additional multiple beyond &times;2 (two effects for &times;3, and so on).</p>",
