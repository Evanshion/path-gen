    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A <i>transformative</i> weapon alters its shape at its wielder's command, becoming any other melee weapon of the same general shape and handedness; the weapon's categorization as simple, martial, or exotic is irrelevant. For example, a Medium <i>transformative longsword</i> can take the shape of any other Medium one-handed melee weapon, such as a scimitar, flail, or trident, but not a Medium light or two-handed melee weapon (such as a Medium short sword or a Medium greatsword). It can even take the shape of comparable weapons of different size categories. For example, a Small greatsword is a two-handed slashing weapon for a Small character, but is a one-handed slashing weapon for a Medium character, which is very similar to a Medium longsword; a Small <i>transformative greatsword</i> can thus become an actual Medium longsword, usable by a Medium creature without the &ndash;2 penalty for using a weapon of the wrong size. The weapon retains all of its abilities, including enhancement bonuses and weapon special abilities, except those prohibited by its current shape. For example, a <i>keen transformative</i> weapon functions normally in the form of a piercing or slashing weapon, but cannot use the <i>keen</i> special ability when in the shape of a bludgeoning weapon. When unattended, the weapon reverts to its true shape.</p>",
