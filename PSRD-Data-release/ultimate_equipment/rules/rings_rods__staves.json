Unlike with other sorts of magic items, the wielder can use his caster level when activating the power of the staff if it's higher than the caster level of the staff. This means that staves are far more potent in the hands of a powerful spellcaster. Because they use the wielder's ability score to set the save DC for the spells, spells from a staff are often harder to resist than those from other magic items, which use the minimum ability score required to cast the spell. Not only are aspects of the spell dependent on caster level (range, duration, and so on) potentially higher, but spells from a staff are also harder to dispel and have a better chance of overcoming spell resistance.</p><p>Staves hold a maximum of 10 charges. Each spell cast from a staff consumes one or more charges. When a staff runs out of charges, it cannot be used until it is recharged. Each morning, when a spellcaster prepares spells or regains spell slots, he can also imbue one staff with a portion of his power, so long as one or more of the spells cast by the staff is on his spell list and he is capable of casting at least one of the spells. Imbuing a staff with this power restores one charge to the staff, but the caster must forgo one prepared spell or spell slot of a level equal to the highest-level spell cast by the staff. A staff cannot gain more than one charge per day, and a caster cannot imbue more than one staff per day.</p><p>A staff can hold spells of any level, and the minimum caster level of a staff is 8th.</p>",

(If this breaking of the staff is purposeful and declared by the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action that does not require the wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot spread. All creatures and objects within 2 squares of the broken staff take an amount of damage equal to 20 &times; the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 15 &times; the number of charges, and those 5 or 6 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 10 &times; the number of charges. All those affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence (01&ndash;50 on a d%), but if she does not, the explosive release of spell energy instantly destroys her. Only certain items, including the <i>staff of the magi</i> and the <i>staff of power</i>, are capable of being used for a retributive strike.</p>",
