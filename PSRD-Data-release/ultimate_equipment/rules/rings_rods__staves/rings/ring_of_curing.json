    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This simple copper ring is a boon to those who spend their lives healing others. Whenever the wearer of a <i>ring of curing </i>casts a conjuration spell of the healing subschool, all maximums to the level-dependent healing provided by that spell increase by 2. For example, <i>cure light wounds</i> would provide a maximum healing of 1d8 + 7 (at 7th caster level), while <i>heal</i> would cure a maximum of 170 points of damage. This ring does not increase the wearer's actual caster level, nor the amount of level-dependent healing provided by any such spell.</p>",
