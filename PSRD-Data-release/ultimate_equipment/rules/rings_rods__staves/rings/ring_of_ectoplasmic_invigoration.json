    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A summoner wearing a <i>ring of ectoplasmic invigoration</i> can use his maker's call class feature to absorb his eidolon (dismissing it in the process) instead of bringing it to his side. He gains 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die of the eidolon and the benefits of a <i>lesser restoration</i> spell. The eidolon must still be within range of his maker's call ability. Any temporary hit points gained fade after 1 hour or when the eidolon is summoned again. A wearer with the transposition ability can transport himself to the eidolon's square (still absorbing and dismissing it) rather than calling the eidolon to him.</p>",
