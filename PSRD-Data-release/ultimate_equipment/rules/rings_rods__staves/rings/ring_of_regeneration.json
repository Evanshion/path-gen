When worn, the ring continually allows a living wearer to heal 1 point of damage per round and an equal amount of nonlethal damage. In addition, the wearer is immune to bleed damage while wearing a <i>ring of regeneration</i>. If the wearer loses a limb, an organ, or any other body part while wearing this ring, the ring regenerates it as the spell <i>regenerate</i>. In either case, only damage taken while wearing the ring is regenerated. </p>",
