Three times per day, the wearer of the ring can, as a move action, use it to form a link with the particular 5-foot square she occupies at that moment. This causes one of the stones on the ring to glow. As a swift action, the wearer of the ring can teleport to any unoccupied linked square within 100 feet.</p>",
