These glowing globes resemble <i>dancing lights</i>, and the wearer controls them similarly (see the <i>dancing lights</i> spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created.</p>",
