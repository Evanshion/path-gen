Once per day as a swift action, when the wearer hits a living creature with an unarmed attack, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or take 1d4 point of Strength damage in addition to the attack's normal damage. If the target of the attack takes any Strength damage from this attack, the ring's wearer gains a +2 enhancement bonus to her Strength for 1 minute. </p>",
