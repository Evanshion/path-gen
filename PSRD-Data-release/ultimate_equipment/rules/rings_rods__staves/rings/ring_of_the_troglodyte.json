Once created, the smell remains, centered on the wearer, until she dismisses it as a free action. This is a poison effect. </p><p class=\"stat-block\">Any creature affected by the disgusting aroma produced by the ring must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw when it starts its turn in the ring's stench radius.
