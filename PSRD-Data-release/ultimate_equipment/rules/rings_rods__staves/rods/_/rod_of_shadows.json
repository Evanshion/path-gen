    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This ebon rod is so dark it seems to absorb the light around it. The rod functions as a <i>+2 light mace</i>, and allows its wielder to see in darkness as if she had the see in darkness ability. Three times per day, the wielder can use it to create a <i>deeper darkness</i> effect (caster level 8th). To use this ability, the rod's wielder must touch the target object, which is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>",
