Once per day, the rod garbs her in magically created clothing of the finest fabrics, and adorns her with furs and jewels.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Apparel created by the magic of the rod remains in existence for 12 hours. However, if the possessor attempts to sell or give away any part of it, use it for a spell component, or the like, all the apparel immediately disappears. The same applies if any of it is forcibly taken from her.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The value of the noble garb created by the rod ranges from 7,000 to 10,000 gp (1d4+6 &times; 1,000 gp)&mdash;1,000 gp for the fabric alone, 5,000 gp for the furs, and the rest for the jewels (maximum of 20 gems; maximum value 200 gp each).</p><p class=\"stat-block\">In addition, the rod has a second special power, usable once per week. Upon command, it creates a palatial tent&mdash;a huge pavilion of silk 60 feet across. Inside the tent are temporary furnishings and food suitable to the splendor of the pavilion and sufficient to entertain as many as 100 people. The tent and its trappings last for 1 day. At the end of that time, the tent and all objects associated with it (including any items that were taken out of the tent) disappear.</p>",
