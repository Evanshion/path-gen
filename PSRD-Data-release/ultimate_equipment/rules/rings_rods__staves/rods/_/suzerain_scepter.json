    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This ornately bejeweled baton confers the mark of rightful rulership on its bearer. The wielder of this scepter gains a +5 competence bonus on Knowledge (nobility) and Diplomacy checks. Furthermore, once per day, and on command, the wielder can affect up to seven living creatures with <i>good hope</i>, as the spell. If the wielder of a <i>suzerain scepter </i>has the Leadership feat, she may attract double the normal number of followers for her Leadership score; however, if the rod is out of the wielder's possession for more than 1 week these extra followers leave. In addition, a <i>suzerain scepter </i>radiates a continuous <i>bless </i>effect that affects any cohort, follower, animal companion, familiar, special mount, or creature charmed or summoned by the wielder (but not called creatures or those under <i>dominate</i> or other compulsion effects). Whenever the wielder creates an effect that provides a morale bonus to such creatures (not including the scepter's <i>bless </i>effect), that bonus increases by 1.</p>",
