The staff allows use of the following spells:</p><ul><li><i>Make whole </i>(1 charge)</li><li><i>Mending</i> (1 charge)</li><li><i>Animate objects </i>(2 charges)</li></ul><p class=\"stat-block\">In addition, once per day, the staff can become a Medium animated object  with the metal special ability. It can remain in this form for up to 10 minutes. If destroyed while in this form, it reverts to being a staff, but it loses all of its charges and this ability cannot be used again until it is fully recharged.</p>",
