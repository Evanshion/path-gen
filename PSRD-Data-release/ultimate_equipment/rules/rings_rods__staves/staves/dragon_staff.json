    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Made from a large dragon bone, wrapped in scales and topped with the fearsome image of a dragon, this staff radiates power. Each dragon staff is linked to one type of chromatic dragon: black, blue, green, red, or white. All the spells that can be cast using the staff are tied to that choice. If the wielder uses the staff to cast <i>form of the dragon II</i>, she must assume the type linked to the staff. Any energy types chosen by spells from the staff must match the type as well (black and green are linked to acid, blue is linked to electricity, red is linked to fire, and white is linked to cold). The staff allows use of the following spells:</p><ul><li><i>Fly </i>(1 charge)</li><li><i>Protection from energy</i> (1 charge)</li><li><i>Dragon's breath</i> (2 charges)</li><li><i>Form of the dragon II </i>(4 charges)</li></ul><p class=\"stat-block\">In addition to these powers, the wielder of the <i>dragon staff</i> also receives a +2 natural armor bonus to her AC and the ability to make a bite attack as a primary natural weapon. This bite deals 1d8 points of damage if the wielder is Medium. These bonuses are a polymorph effect and are replaced by those gained from casting <i>form of the dragon II</i>, or other similar spells.</p>",
