Pellets and black powder are kept in tiny individual pouches, and bullets in small loops. The bandolier alters itself as needed to accommodate both. There are also places on the <i>beneficial bandolier</i> for a gunsmith's kit and a powder horn. Regardless of what quantities of these items are placed within the <i>beneficial bandolier</i>, its weight does not change.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">As a swift action, the wearer can command a single round of ammunition from the <i>beneficial bandolier</i> to teleport into a firearm of the appropriate type that he is wielding.</p>",
