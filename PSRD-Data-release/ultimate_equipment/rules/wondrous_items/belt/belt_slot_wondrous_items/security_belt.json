The wearer also gets a +5 bonus to CMD against the steal maneuver. Once per day on command, the wearer can touch a single item of up to 10 cubic feet and shrink it into a tiny cloth duplicate as the <i>shrink item </i>spell. With a move action, the wearer can draw one of these items from one of the belt's pockets and return it to normal size<i>. </i>It is difficult to detect a <i>security belt </i>and any items in the pockets as magic. They are affected as though a constant <i>magic aura</i> spell were making them appear nonmagical.</p>",
