    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This red and orange silk robe gives viewers the impression of a flame roiling just below the fabric's slick surface. The robe grants the wearer fire resistance 5 and increases the wearer's caster level for all spells with the fire descriptor by +1. Once per day on command, the wearer of the robe can emit a 20-foot-radius burst of fire. Creatures other than the wearer within the area take 2d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 16 half).</p>",
