    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">The cut and color of this solemn vestment varies from religion to religion, but its properties are the same. The wearer may command the <i>cassock of the clergy </i>to display the holy symbol of her deity or hide this symbol. At the most basic level, the garment functions as a divine focus. Additionally, the wearer gains a +3 competence bonus on Charisma-based checks to influence creatures that match her alignment or that of her patron deity. Also, the wearer may use <i>bless </i>and <i>sanctuary </i>(DC 11) each once per day, and may prepare one additional orison each day. If the wearer is a spontaneous divine caster, once per day she may spend 1 hour in prayer to gain an orison of her choice as a spell known for the next 24 hours.</p>",
