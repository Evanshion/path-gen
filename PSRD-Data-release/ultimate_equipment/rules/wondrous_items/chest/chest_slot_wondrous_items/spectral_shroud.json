The morbid burial shroud grants the wearer some affinity with the spectral dead. The wearer can discern invisible or ethereal creatures as though using <i>see invisibility</i>. Once per day, the wearer can become incorporeal for 10 rounds and gain a fly speed equal to half his base speed with perfect maneuverability. The wearer can't attack while incorporeal, but can dismiss the effect as a move action.</p>",
