Some believe these items were made to grant lesser swordmasters the illusion of skill. When the wearer places the blindfold over her eyes, she becomes blinded, but gains blindsight  within the reach of her melee weapon, or 5 feet if the wearer is not wielding a melee weapon. Furthermore, the wearer is under the effect of a constant <i>locate weakness</i> (<i>Ultimate Combat</i> 236) spell, but only when making melee attacks.</p>",
