When making a forced march , for each hour of marching beyond 8 hours, the wearer needs only to make a Constitution check (DC 10, +1 per extra hour) instead of the normal check. Furthermore, if the wearer fails the check, she only takes 1d4 points of nonlethal damage and does not becomes fatigued the first time she takes nonlethal damage in this way.</p>",
