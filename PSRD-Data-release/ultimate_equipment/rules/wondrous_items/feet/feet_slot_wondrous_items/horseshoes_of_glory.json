    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">These massive horseshoes sport deadly spikes that jut from their front. Once per day on command, the rider of a mount wearing these shoes may choose to either increase the mount's size by one size increment (maximum Huge), or change its type to magical beast, as <i>beast shape IV</i>. In addition, while the mount is augmented in either of these two ways, it gains DR/5 chaos, evil, good, or law (selected by the rider). These horseshoes are part of a set and require all four to be worn by the same animal to properly function.</p>",
