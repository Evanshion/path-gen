In addition, up to 3 times per day, the wearer can activate the claws as a swift action to gain the benefits of <i>spider climb</i> for 1 round. The wearer cannot hold anything else in her hands while using claws of the ice bear. If used as a weapon, <i>claws of the ice bear</i> function as spiked gauntlets.</p>",
