Once donned, the <i>talons of Leng</i> grant the wearer a natural claw attack with each hand that deal 1d4 points of damage for a Medium wearer, or 1d3 points of damage for a Small wearer. These claw attacks have a +3 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. On a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or become permanently confused as per the <i>insanity</i> spell. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The wearer of the <i>talons of Leng</i> is immune to effects that grant the confused condition. For as long as she wears the talons, however, her Wisdom is reduced by 2, as alien voices constantly whisper through her head. The <i>talons of Leng</i> do not interfere with spellcasting, the use of handheld items, or wielding weapons.</p>",
