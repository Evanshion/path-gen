Three times per day as a swift action, the helm fires an unerring tongue of force at a visible target within 20 feet.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If the target is an unattended object weighing 250 pounds or less, it is pulled 20 feet toward the wearer. If the target is a creature of the wearer's size or smaller, the wearer may make a combat maneuver check as a free action to pull the target 20 feet toward him.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If the target is a creature larger than the wearer, an unattended object weighing more than 250 pounds, or an immobile structure such as a wall, the wearer is pulled 20 feet toward the target.
