The wearer's voice carries great authority and can inspire others to victory. As a swift action, the wearer can speak words of encouragement or advice to an ally within 30 feet. That ally gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks until the start of the wearer's next turn. The wearer can use the laurel to grant this bonus to himself. A creature cannot gain this bonus more than once per day.</p>",
