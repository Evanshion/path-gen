A <i>soulbound eye</i> must be attached to a willing or helpless creature by pressing the spike-covered surface to the creature's brow&mdash;the gem swiftly and painfully embeds itself in the victim's forehead, immediately activating to forge a shared link between the wearer and the creature who placed the item on its head (the &ldquo;master&rdquo;).</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Once implanted, the <i>soulbound eye</i> allows the master to observe the world around the wearer through the wearer's senses. It also allows for telepathic communication between the wearer and the master. Neither of these features function across planar boundaries.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The <i>soulbound eye's</i> wearer is not compelled to obey its master's telepathic commands, but the master can use the <i>soulbound eye</i> as a conduit for <i>hold monster</i>, <i>modify memory</i>, <i>pain strike</i> , and <i>suggestion</i> spells, treating the wearer as the target of the spell no matter the distance between master and wearer. The victim is allowed any normal saving throws or spell resistance against spells cast through the <i>soulbound eye.</i></p><p class=\"stat-block\">An implanted <i>soulbound eye</i> functions like a cursed item once it is in place&mdash;it can only be removed if the curse is first lifted via an effect like <i>remove curse</i> or <i>break enchantment</i>. Once removed, a <i>soulbound eye</i> crumbles to fragments.</p>",
