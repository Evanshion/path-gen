    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This simple copper headband has a small yellow gem set so that when it rests upon the forehead of the wearer, the yellow gem sits perched on the wearer's brow as if it were a third eye in the middle of her forehead. Often, the headband contains additional designs to further accentuate the appearance of a third, crystal eye.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The headband grants the wearer an enhancement bonus to two mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) of +2, +4, or +6. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">These bonuses are chosen when the headband is created and cannot be changed. If the headband grants a bonus to Intelligence, it also grants skill ranks as a <i>headband of vast intelligence.</i></p>",
