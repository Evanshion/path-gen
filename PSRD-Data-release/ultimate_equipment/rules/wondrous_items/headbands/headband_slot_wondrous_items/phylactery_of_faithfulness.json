    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This item is a tiny box containing religious scripture. The box is affixed to a leather cord and tied around the forehead, worn so that the box sits upon the wearer's brow. There is no mundane way to determine what function this religious item performs until it is worn. The wearer of a <i>phylactery of faithfulness</i> is aware of any action or item that could adversely affect her alignment and her standing with her deity, including magical effects. She acquires this information prior to performing such an action or becoming associated with such an item if she takes a moment to contemplate the act.</p>",
