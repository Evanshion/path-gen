The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a <i>fireball</i> spell (Reflex DC 14 half).</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Each necklace of fireballs contains a combination of spheres of various strengths. Some traditional combinations, designated types I through VII, are detailed above.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.</p>",

If the wearer is a barbarian of at least 12th level, she gains fearless rage as a bonus rage power. If she already has this power, she also becomes immune to the panicked condition while raging, and any panic-causing attack against her while she rages instead causes her to regain 1 round of rage.</p>",
