See Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities for a list of abilities. Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses. An <i>amulet of mighty fists</i> cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +5.
