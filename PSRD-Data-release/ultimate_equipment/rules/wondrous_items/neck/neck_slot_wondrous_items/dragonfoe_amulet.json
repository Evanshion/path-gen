    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This amulet consists of a cracked dragon scale set in a disk of gold. Most are slightly damaged, bearing the scars of draconic breath weapons. The <i>dragonfoe amulet</i> is a powerful, specialized tool for those who oppose dragons, improving the protection and attacks of the wearer in a number of ways.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The wearer of a <i>dragonfoe amulet</i> ignores the damage reduction of dragons. This only affects actual dragons, not all creatures of the dragon type. In addition, if the wearer casts a spell against a dragon, she can roll twice to overcome any spell resistance the dragon might possess, taking the higher result. Lastly, the wearer takes no damage instead of half damage on a successful Reflex save against a dragon's breath weapon (as the evasion ability).</p>",
