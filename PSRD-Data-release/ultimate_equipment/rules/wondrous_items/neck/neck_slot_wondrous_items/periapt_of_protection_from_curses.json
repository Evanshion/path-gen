Three times per day, whenever the wearer rolls a saving throw against a curse (such as a witch's hex, or a <i>bestow curse</i> spell), he may reroll the saving throw as an immediate action. The wearer must decide to use this ability before the results of the saving throw are revealed. He must take the second roll, even if it is worse.</p>",
