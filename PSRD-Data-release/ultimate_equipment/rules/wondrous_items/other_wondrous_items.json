    "body": "<p>Wondrous items not worn in one of the magic item slots are called &ldquo;slotless&rdquo; wondrous items. Sometimes these items take the form of trinkets, like the <i>figurines of wondrous power.</i> other times they are larger items, such as the <i>carpet of flying</i>. Typically the possession of such an item is enough to gain its benefit, but sometimes one must manipulate and activate the item. Slotless wondrous items are the largest category and most diverse of the wondrous items. </p>",
