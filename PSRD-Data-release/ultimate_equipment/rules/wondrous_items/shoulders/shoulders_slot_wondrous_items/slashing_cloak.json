As a full-round action, the wearer can spin in his space, damaging each creature within 5 feet. This attack uses the wearer's highest base attack bonus against each creature, and deals 2d6 damage on a hit. The wearer is considered proficient with this attack. Furthermore, the cloak can be magically enhanced like a melee weapon, adding the cost of the melee weapon property to the cloak's cost.</p>",
