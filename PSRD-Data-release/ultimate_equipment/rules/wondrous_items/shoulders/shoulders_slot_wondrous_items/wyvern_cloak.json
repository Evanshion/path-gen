    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This heavy cloak is made of blue scaled leather and has a pointed hem that hangs near the ground. The cloak provides the wearer a +4 resistance bonus on Will saves, a continuous <i>feather fall</i> effect (as the spell), and the ability to use <i>fly</i> once per day. At will as a swift action, the wearer can form the hem into a stinger, granting her a sting natural weapon. This sting deals 1d6 points of damage plus <i>poison</i> (as the spell; DC 16). Reverting the stinger to its normal, inconspicuous shape is a free action.</p>",
