    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">An <i>apparatus of the crab</i> is a metallic magical vehicle. When unoccupied, it appears to be a large, sealed iron barrel big enough to hold two Medium creatures. Close examination, and a DC 20 Perception check, reveals a secret catch that opens a hatch at one end. Anyone who crawls inside finds 10 (unlabeled) levers and seating for two Medium or Small occupants. These levers allow those inside to activate and control the apparatus's movements and actions.</p>",
