    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This tiny silver cube is activated by throwing it at an intersection of squares within 50 feet. The cube hovers 5 feet above the ground at that location for the next 5 rounds. Any small projectile or thrown weapon (such as arrows, shuriken, vials, and bullets) that passes through the squares adjacent to the cube automatically turn in midair to hit the cube (no attack roll needed) instead of their intended target. The cube has 5 hit points and hardness 8. If the <i>arrow magnet</i> is touched by a creature or reduced to 0 hit points or less, it falls to the ground and is destroyed.</p>",
