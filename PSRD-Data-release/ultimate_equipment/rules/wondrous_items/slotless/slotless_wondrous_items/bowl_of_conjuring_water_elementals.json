The bowl must be filled with fresh or salt water to function. On command as a full-round action, the bearer may summon a water elemental. If the bowl is filled with salt water, it conjures a Huge water elemental as if using <i>summon monster VI</i>. If filled with fresh water, it conjures a Large water elemental as if using <i>summon monster V</i>. Conjuring an elemental empties the bowl. The bowl cannot summon another elemental until the previous one is dismissed, killed, or the duration of its summoning expires.</p>",
