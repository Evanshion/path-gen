    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This device appears to be a normal container for holding burning coals. The brazier must be filled with coals or wood and a fire lit within it to function. On command as a full-round action, the bearer may summon a fire elemental. If 1 pound of brimstone (sulfur) is burning in the brazier, it conjures a Huge fire elemental as if using <i>summon monster VI</i>. Otherwise, the brazier conjures a Large fire elemental as if using <i>summon monster V</i>. Conjuring an elemental extinguishes the fire in the brazier. The brazier cannot summon another elemental until the previous one is dismissed, killed, or the duration of its summoning expires.</p>",
