    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This clean-smelling white candle is inscribed with glyphs portraying various sweet smelling flowers. When lit, the candle repels smoke, mist, cloud, and other gas effects in a 5-foot radius. These effects do not penetrate the area around the candle if they are of spell level 3 or lower. Against more powerful cloud effects (including effects not based on spells, such as dragon breath or a gorgon's breath weapon), the candle grants creatures in the area a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against these effects. Creatures in the area gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks from creatures with the air subtype.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The candle burns for up to 5 minutes, in increments of 1 minute. Once all 5 minutes are used, the candle is destroyed. </p>",
