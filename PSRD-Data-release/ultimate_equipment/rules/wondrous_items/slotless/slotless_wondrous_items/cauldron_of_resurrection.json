    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">The mouth of this heavy, dark iron cauldron is shaped like a monstrous maw and is large enough to accommodate a single Medium creature. When the cauldron is filled with pure water and certain rare and sacred herbs, and a deceased creature is placed inside it, the cauldron can restore the creature to life as if with a <i>raise dead </i>or <i>resurrection</i> spell. The spell effect depends on the components used: <i>raise dead</i> costs 5,000 gp worth of materials, while <i>resurrection</i> costs 10,000 gp worth of materials. The cauldron is usable once per day.</p>",
