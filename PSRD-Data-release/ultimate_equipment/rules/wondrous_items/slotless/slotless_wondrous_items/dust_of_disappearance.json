    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This dust looks like <i>dust of appearance</i> and is typically stored in the same manner. A creature or object touched by it becomes invisible (as <i>greater invisibility</i>). Normal vision can't see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they be detected by magical means, including <i>see invisibility</i> or <i>invisibility purge</i>. <i>Dust of appearance</i>, however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by <i>dust of disappearance</i>. Other factors, such as sound and smell, also allow possible detection. The <i>greater invisibility</i> bestowed by the dust lasts for 2d6 rounds. The invisible creature doesn't know when the duration will end.</p>",
