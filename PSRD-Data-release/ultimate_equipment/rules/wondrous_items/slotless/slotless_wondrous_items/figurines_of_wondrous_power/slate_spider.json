            "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This statuette of a spider with stubby legs can be used once per day for 1 minute. When activated, the figurine sprouts longer, segmented legs, and scampers about the bearer, picking lint off robes, chiseling grime from armor, or otherwise grooming the bearer. If commanded to do so (a free action), it perches on the muzzle of a one-handed or two-handed firearm barrel and, after the firearm is fired, travels down the barrel and cleans out the firearm. Each time the slate spider cleans a firearm, the next shot the firearm fires has no chance of misfiring. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>animate objects</i>.</p>",
