    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This small crude-looking drum is attached to a strap long enough to loop around the wearer's neck. A successful DC 12 Perform (percussion) check activates the drum, which enhances any nearby natural or magical fire as long as the bearer spends a move action each round to continue playing. All fires (including fire spells and effects) within 30 feet of the bearer deal an additional +1 point of fire damage per die (maximum +10).</p><p class=\"stat-block\">All unattended flammable alchemical objects such as tindertwigs, flasks of oil or alchemist's fire, and fireworks within this range have a 10% chance of spontaneously igniting or exploding (as appropriate to the item) when the drum activates. This chance increases by 5% each round and is checked at the start of the performer's turn as long as the playing continues.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A <i>greater goblin fire drum</i> has all the above abilities and can <i>create pyrotechnics</i> once per day.</p>",
