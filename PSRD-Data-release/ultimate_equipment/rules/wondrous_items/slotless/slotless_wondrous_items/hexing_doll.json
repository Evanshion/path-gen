    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This malevolent-looking doll is made out of cheap rags and embroidery thread and is stuffed with straw or sawdust. A creature holding or carrying the doll takes a &ndash;4 penalty on saving throws against witch hexes. Alternatively, if the doll is stuffed with the hair of a creature, any witch holding the doll increases the DC of her hexes by +2 when using the hexes against that creature. A doll used in this way does not cause the witch to take a penalty on her saving throws.</p>",
