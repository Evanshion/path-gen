Once per day, when the flat back of the gargoyle face is placed against a wall, floor, or ceiling, it fuses into place, creating a usable door and penetrating the space beyond up to 1 foot as if using <i>passwall</i>. Speaking the command word again ends the <i>passwall</i> effect, returns the surface to its previous doorless shape, and releases the doorknocker from the surface.</p>",
