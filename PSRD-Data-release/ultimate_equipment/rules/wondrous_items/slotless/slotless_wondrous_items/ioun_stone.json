    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">These crystalline stones always float in the air and must be within 3 feet of their owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires a stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, a stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow a stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. <i>Ioun stones</i> have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5. The powers of each stone vary depending on its color and shape (see the table on page 306).</p><p class=\"stat-block\">Regeneration from the <i>pearly white ioun stone</i> works like a <i>ring of regeneration</i>. It only cures damage taken while the character is using the stone. The pale lavender and lavender-and-green stones work like a <i>rod of absorption</i>, but absorbing a spell requires a readied action, and these stones cannot be used to empower spells. Stored spells in the vibrant purple stone must be placed by a spellcaster but can be used by anyone (see<i> ring of minor spell storing</i>). See table on next page.</p>",
