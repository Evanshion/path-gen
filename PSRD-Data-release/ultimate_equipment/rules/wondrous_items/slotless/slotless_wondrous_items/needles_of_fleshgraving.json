    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">These tattooing needles can grant a +5 competence bonus on Craft (tattoos) checks. Once per day they can be used to transform an object into a tattoo on a willing creature. This takes 10 minutes. The object may resist with a DC 17 Fortitude saving throw. The transformed object radiates faint transmutation magic and looks like a miniature depiction of itself. The bearer of the tattoo may peel it off as a standard action, transforming it back into its object form. The tattoo automatically reverts back to its object form after 7 days, if dispelled (using the caster level of the needles), or upon the death of the tattooed creature. </p>",
