    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">A stone of this nature is typically an oddly shaped bit of roughly polished rock. On command as a full-round action, the bearer may summon an earth elemental. If there is an unbroken piece of unworked stone of at least Huge size nearby, the stone conjures a Huge earth elemental as if using <i>summon monster VI</i>. If there is no such stone available (for example, if there is only sand, earth, worked stone, or smaller pieces of stone), the stone conjures a Large earth elemental as if using <i>summon monster V</i>. The stone cannot summon another elemental until the previous one is dismissed, killed, or the duration of its summoning expires.</p>",
