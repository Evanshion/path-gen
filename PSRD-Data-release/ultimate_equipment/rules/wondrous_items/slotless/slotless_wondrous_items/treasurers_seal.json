    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Six inches in diameter, one side of this porcelain seal shows a many-keyholed padlock, while the other displays a lightning bolt superimposed on an open hand. The padlock side is used to lock and alarm doors, chests, and other portals. The bearer may speak a command word to activate it when holding it against a lockable item. If the padlock side of the seal is touching the item, it bestows an <i>alarm</i> (mental alarm) and <i>arcane lock</i> on the target item. If the lightning bolt side of the seal is touching the item, it casts <i>fire trap</i> on the lock (the seal must be held to the lock for 10 minutes to use this ability).</p><p class=\"stat-block\">A creature carrying the seal can speak a command word to suspend its effects on an item for 1 minute. This ability is usable at will, but only works on effects created by that specific seal.</p><p class=\"stat-block\">The seal can be used at will but can only maintain effects on three items at any given time. Using it on a fourth item automatically negates the oldest effect. </p>",
