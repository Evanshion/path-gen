    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">Infused with the essence of destruction, a pinch of void dust unmakes force effects. If sprinkled on or thrown at a force effect, it acts as a <i>dispel magic</i>, unless the force effect is immune to <i>dispel magic</i>, in which case it acts like <i>disintegrate</i>. <i>Void dust</i> can be sprinkled on an adjacent force effect or thrown up to 10 feet. No attack roll is required. A single pinch affects only a single force effect. A found container holds three pinches.</p>",
