    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">This strange, interdimensional device looks just like a <i>portable hole</i>. Anything placed within it is immediately cast to another world&mdash;a parallel world, another planet, or a different plane (chosen randomly). If the well is moved, it opens to a new plane (also randomly determined). It can be picked up, folded, or rolled, just as a <i>portable hole</i> can be. Objects from the world the well touches can come through the opening just as easily&mdash;it is a two-way portal.</p>",
