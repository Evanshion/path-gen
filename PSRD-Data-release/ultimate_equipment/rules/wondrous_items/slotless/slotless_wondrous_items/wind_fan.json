By uttering the command word, its possessor causes the fan to duplicate a <i>gust of wind</i> spell. The fan can be used once per day with no risk. If it is used more frequently, there is a 20% cumulative chance per usage during that day that the device tears into useless, nonmagical tatters.</p>",
