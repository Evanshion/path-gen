A roll of 01 indicates the wondrous item is intelligent, 02&ndash;31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function (or if the item is command word-activated, that it has the command word or words written on it), and 32&ndash;100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes (see Intelligent Items). Wondrous items with charges can never be intelligent.</p>",
