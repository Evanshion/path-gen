    "body": "<p class=\"stat-block\">These thick brass and leather gauntlets allow the wearer to tear through bone and muscle like paper. Once per day, as part of a melee attack, the wearer can activate the gauntlets to inflict a horrific injury on an opponent. If the attack hits, the target must make a DC 14 Will save. If the save fails, the Wand reduces the target's Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution (wearer's choice) by &ndash;6. This penalty cannot reduce the target's ability score below 1. The injury heals over time, reducing the penalty by 1 for each day that passes since the time of the injury, and is immediately removed by <i>heal</i>, <i>regenerate</i>, <i>restoration</i>, or any magic that can break a curse.</p>",
