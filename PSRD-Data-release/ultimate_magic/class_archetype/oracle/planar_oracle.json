Your type changes to &ldquo;outsider (extraplanar),&rdquo; except on your associated plane, where your type is &ldquo;outsider (native).&rdquo; In addition, you gain immunity to your associated energy type and gain damage reduction 10/magic. Unlike other outsiders, you can still be brought back from the dead as if you were a member of your previous creature type. This replaces the final revelation of the oracle's mystery.</p>",
