A concussive spell causes creatures that take damage from a spell that has the sonic descriptor to take a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for a number of rounds equal to the actual spell level of the spell. A concussive spell only affects spells with the sonic descriptor. A concussive spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.</p>",
