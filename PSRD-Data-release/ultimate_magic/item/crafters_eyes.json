    "body": "<p class=\"stat-description-2\">The crafter gives her construct crystalline eyes that permit her to use a <i>scrying</i> or <i>greater scrying</i> spell to see from the perspective of her creation. This modification requires the crafter also to prepare a special crystalline orb magically bonded to the eyes, which serves as her focus for the <i>scrying</i> or <i>greater scrying</i> spell. The cost of creating that focus is included in the cost of modifying the construct. </p><p class=\"stat-description-indent-2\">Unlike normal <i>scrying</i> or<i> greater scrying</i>, there is no chance of failure for viewing creatures though the sensor; the creator simply sees what the construct sees for the duration of the spell. Spells cast through the sensor still have the normal chance of operating through the construct's eyes. </p>",
