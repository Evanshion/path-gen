If you can devote yourself in body and soul to a god&mdash;and why wouldn't you, when there's such a variety to choose from?&mdash;you may find yourself endowed with magical powers simply for having faith in your god's (and your own) righteousness. Oracles are chosen without their consent, far-roving rangers pick up magical tricks and traps, druids channel the will of nature, sorcerers get their abilities as dubious presents from philandering ancestors, and bards find magical inspiration in performance and art. Magic is everywhere in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, and many of the movers and shakers in towns and cities of any significant size have a spell or two up their sleeves.</p><p>But those are just ordinary people who have access to magic. Basic hedge wizards may make a fine living crafting glowing swords, and a priest with the ability to heal broken bones is a must for any church that wants to win itself a congregation, but such everyday spellcasters are hardly the stuff of legend. Instead, those magic users who get remembered as heroes and legends&mdash;rather than simply magical craftsmen and merchants&mdash;take these same techniques and build upon them, seeking out ever-more-elusive knowledge and crafting new spells of magnificent power. It is with these esoteric practices that the greatest make names for themselves; these potent arts  set the masters apart from mundane practitioners.</p><p>This chapter introduces several new subsystems and guidelines that help true acolytes of the magical arts hone their skills, and take them beyond the simple spells and constraints of lesser casters. In addition to in-game systems for crafting constructs, binding outsiders, and more, this section also includes dangerous new conditions called spellblights that afflict only casters, plus details for both players and Game Masters alike on how to design new spells for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and make sure that they're properly balanced and thought through ahead of time&mdash;before they wreak havoc at your gaming table.</p><p>Major subjects and subsystems covered in this chapter include the following.</p>",

Spellblights are specific curses that only affect spellcasters and creatures that use spell-like abilities, saddling them with a host of unfortunate conditions that are extremely difficult to get rid of and greatly hinder the victim's use of magic. (Fortunately, some of these curses have also been discovered to have beneficial side effects that cursed casters can use to their advantage.) Divided into both major and minor categories, spellblights include such grotesque conditions as hemoculysis&mdash;in which the caster bleeds from the eyes each time she casts a spell&mdash;as well as gentler but more inconvenient afflictions such as phase blight and spell addiction.</p>",

This need to prepare multiples (thus limiting her versatility) is the only effect.

Such discussions typically happen before the duel, allowing both sides to properly prepare, but as with all elements of a duel, this is not always the case. Most duels utilize the following simple rules.</p><ul><li>\tEach participant must fight alone and can receive no help from outside sources, with the exception of familiars or other bonded creatures.</li><li>\tEach participant must fight with magic. The use of melee or ranged weapons is forbidden, with the exception of bonded objects and weapons that can cast spells, such as staves.</li><li>\tThe use of summoned or otherwise conjured creatures is forbidden, unless the duel expects such creatures to combat one another at the behest of the participants (rather than directly attacking the dueling opponent). This sort of creature duel is common among druids, summoners, and conjurers.</li><li>\tThe duel lasts until one of the casters has been knocked unconscious or otherwise prevented from continuing. Spells such as <i>hold person</i> do not end duels, but <i>flesh to stone</i> certainly does, assuming the target fails her saving throw.

Because duels are always planned and expected, there is never a surprise round. Alternatively, some duels start off with each side facing off, waiting for the other to flinch or break resolve. In such cases, substitute a Bluff, Intimidate, or Sense Motive check in place of the standard initiative check. The skill used is decided by the individual participants and is reflective of their approach to the duel.</p><p>At the beginning of each round, the participants check the status of the duel (the GM may want to mark the beginning of each round in some way during initiative tracking as a reminder to check this status). So long as all participants agree to continue dueling, the duel goes on. If any one of the participants withdraws from the duel, the duel immediately ends for all participants, even those who want to see it continue. The participant or side that ended the duel is considered the loser of the duel. The duel's remaining participants can, among themselves, agree to resume the duel, but this is considered a separate duel from the previous one and does not involve those who withdrew from the duel.</p><p>Each participant in a duel can act normally on her turn, but if she casts a spell, that spell must affect or target either herself or one of the other duel participants (whether this participant is an ally or an opponent). For example, a dueling mage could not cast <i>haste</i> on her allies and exclude herself, but she could cast it on herself and her allies. The same goes for offensive spells, such as <i>fireball</i>&mdash;the dueling caster must include one of her opponents in the duel among the targets of the spell, and could not affect some nearby creatures to the exclusion of her opponent.</p><p>In addition to the normal set of actions a dueling caster can perform each round, each participant in a duel may take a special counterspell action called a dueling counter, as noted below.</p>",

A dueling counter is similar to a counterspell, but is easier to use. </p><p>When a dueling opponent tries to cast a spell, the targeted spellcaster can make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spell's level) as a free action. If the check succeeds, she identifies her opponent's spell and can attempt a dueling counter. If it fails, she cannot attempt a dueling counter against that spell. </p><p>A dueling counter is an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. To attempt a dueling counter, the countering duelist must expend a spell or a spell slot of a level equal to or higher than that of the spell being cast. Note that characters who cast spells spontaneously (such as bards and sorcerers) must choose what exact spell they are using to counterspell in addition to the slot being used. The countering duelist must then make a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the spell's caster level. Unlike when using a true counterspell action (which requires a readied action), even expending an exact copy of the spell being cast does not guarantee success. The caster attempting the counterspell receives a bonus or penalty on her check depending upon the level of the spell slot expended and the exact spell used, as noted in Table 2&ndash;3. If the check is successful, the spell is countered&mdash;it is negated and the spell is lost. If not, the spell happens as normal and the duelist attempting to counter the spell takes a &ndash;2 penalty on any saving throws made against the spell's effect.</p><p>Alternatively, a spellcaster can use <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>greater dispel magic</i> as a dueling counter. When a dueling spellcaster does so, she does not need to identify the spell being cast, can counter a spell of any level, and must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 11 + the spell's caster level. When <i>dispel magic</i> is used as a dueling counter, it is not modified by any of the circumstances in Table 2&ndash;3.</p><p>Because readying to counterspell is its own action, a participant can choose to ready to counterspell and make a dueling counter in the same round. This is only useful if the participant is facing multiple opponents or someone with access to Quickened Spell or other abilities that allow casting two spells in the same round.</p>",

In some places, magical duels of this kind are so common that special areas are constructed specifically for duels. Such dueling yards are sometimes made with special magic that can be activated for dueling competitions, converting all damage to nonlethal damage and preventing or reversing magic that instantly slays a foe or does permanent harm.

                            "body": "<p>This section provides guidelines for those seeking to calculate the costs of crafting their own constructs. As a rough guideline, a construct's price is equal to its challenge rating squared, then multiplied by 500 gp. Constructs with a fractional CR rating base their price on that fraction of 500 gp. For example, a CR 1/2 construct has a price of 250 gp. The cost of magical supplies for the Craft Construct feat is half this price, with the construct taking 1 day to create per 1,000 gp of the construct's base price. Some constructs, particularly golems, have additional raw material costs that must be paid in full, regardless of whether the creator possesses the Craft Construct feat. Raw materials typically cost somewhere between 5% and 10% of the construct's base price.</p><p>Constructs with multiple special abilities cost more to create. The first special ability is included in the construct's base cost. The next two special abilities increase the calculated price by +1/2 CR per ability. Thereafter, any additional special abilities add +1 CR per ability. Examples of special abilities include having a higher DR value than a typical construct of its CR (above DR 5 for CRs 1&ndash;8, above DR 10 for CR 9+), monster statistics that exceed those recommended for the construct's CR (see Monster Statistics by CR), the standard golem immunity to magic, DR or hardness that can't be overcome by all adamantine weapons, ability to be fully healed by a single spell, and most special attacks and special qualities.</p><p>Particularly powerful special abilities, such as an iron golem's exceptionally high attack bonus, count as two lesser abilities. Animated objects are a special case&mdash;their base price is not increased by any abilities paid for with Construction Points (see the Animated Object description), since these abilities are already factored into an animated object's CR. In addition, golems and homunculi created with extra Hit Dice, the advanced template, or shield guardian abilities should all be priced as described previously, rather than by adjusting pricing for their new CR.</p><p>Abilities that weaken or potentially place a construct at a disadvantage rarely reduce the construct's price. An exception is the berserk ability. Constructs that have a chance of going berserk receive &ndash;1 CR adjustment to their calculated price if control can be reestablished (like a flesh golem) or &ndash;2 CR adjustment for permanent loss of control (like a clay golem). </p><p>The following is an example of the calculated costs for creating a stone golem (CR 11). A stone golem's special abilities are golem immunity to magic, full healing from <i>transmute mud to rock</i>, a high to-hit bonus (+22 vs. the +19 typical for CR 11), and the ability to slow its foes. Further, since its spell vulnerabilities are not tied to common spells or effects, its immunity to magic cost is doubled, giving the stone golem a total of 5 special abilities. The first special ability doesn't affect the cost, the next two increase the cost by +1/2 CR each, and the final two each increase the cost by +1 CR individually, making its effective CR for pricing equal to 14. This produces a calculated price of 98,000 gp, rounded up to an even 100,000 gp.</p><p>When designing a new construct, keep in mind that the above pricing formula only serves as a guideline. As with magic items, construct pricing remains more art than science, and like magic items, compare new constructs to existing ones for guidance. If you're not sure, err on the side of a higher price.</p>",

                            "body": "<p>The arcane method for binding insiders is more difficult. First, a binder must create a trap, a <i>magic circle</i> (see  Magic Circle Against Evil for an example of how this works) focused inward. Typically the circle is outlined in a substance that is anathema to the outsider he wishes to summon. He must protect this circle against any sort of disruption, for even the smallest variation in its energies opens the circle and allows the escape of the creature he has summoned. It is for this reason that most binders' lairs are in high towers or deep dungeons, far from wind or pests. </p><p>When an arcane caster speaks the words of the <i>planar binding</i> spell, the outsider can resist via a Will saving throw, with no aid from its spell resistance. If it fails the save, the <i>magic circle</i> draws it inexorably into the trap. Once there, the outsider can pit its spell resistance as a check against the caster's level, attempt to flee via dimensional travel, or attempt to overcome the spell by imposing its spiritual presence with a Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 the caster's level + the caster's Charisma modifier). Succeeding at any of these checks breaks the binding, and a fortunate binder suffers no additional harm from such a breach; the annoyed outsider just leaves. This is not always the case, however.</p><p>Some outsiders lash out at their failed binders. Because of this, many binders take additional precautions: a second <i>magic circle</i> in which they can stand, and <i>dimensional anchor</i> cast within the <i>magic circle</i> to prevent the conjured outsider from fleeing instantly. A tremendously powerful wizard or sorcerer might even use <i>trap the soul</i> on his victim, forcing it into a prepared vessel until it agrees to the binder's strictures.</p><p>Smart arcane binders often make deals with the creatures they call. Like clerics using <i>planar ally</i>, they bargain and shower the outsider with gifts in exchange for their services. While it is always good for an arcane spellcaster to make these deals from a position of strength, it is much better to get the outsider to come to mutually agreed upon terms for the service, rather than forcing it to commit actions against its nature or desires. </p>",

                    "body": "<p>There is one method of outsider coercion that helps guarantee that a binder can bargain from a position of relative security. Many spellcasters believe that a true name is inscribed on the essence of every creature, a secret word that describes it so perfectly and utterly that to speak the name is to define the being. For mortals, this name is buried in the soul, hidden away from prying and dangerous eyes. Outsiders' true names take the form of sigils carved upon their very essence. In Hell, these sigils change as the devil changes in stature, and some that may once have held power over certain devils have become outdated. It is said that some outsiders have assumed names and that they use the aliases to lure foolish mortals into using for summoning; the outsider pretends to be under the control of the binder, but merely bides its time before it strikes.</p><p>To discover a single outsider's true name, a spellcaster must spend at least a month in a library or on a quest of discovery to uncover occult mysteries and riddles hidden in the pages of books, scrolls, and glyphs written millennia ago, buried in ancient temples or found among the ravings of madmen's spellbooks. At the end of this month, the GM makes a Knowledge (planes) check for the character. The DC is 10 + the creature's Hit Dice. The GM can increase the DC by +2, +5, or even +10, based on the power of the outsider or the circumstances of the true name search. A failure by 5 or more turns up false information that may expose researchers to unexpected dangers. </p><p>For most outer-planar outsiders, knowledge of the creature's true name is a powerful weapon. In summoning, if the name is spoken correctly (requiring knowledge of at least one of the outsider's languages, or a Linguistics skill check with a DC equal to 10 + the creature's Hit Dice), the target takes a &ndash;5 penalty on the Will save to resist being conjured, and if its name is inscribed in the protective <i>magic circle</i>, the outsider takes a &ndash;5 penalty on all checks to escape or breach that circle.</p><p>For elementals (including geniekind), such true names are not binding as they are for fiends and other outsiders, and do not give the creature a penalty to its Will save to resist being summoned. However, if the caster speaks the true name of the elemental, the elemental will most likely be intrigued enough to listen&mdash;a wizard with power and cunning enough to find an elemental's true name is a wizard with guile and strength, and elementals treasure these qualities.</p><p>Not all outsiders have true names. The chaotic and primeval nature of proteans defies the strange logic of true names, as does the writhing chaotic nature of the qlippoth. It is unclear whether aeons have true names. There are those sages who believe each aeon has two true names, and only by finding out both names can a creature gain some control over the aeon, but such matters are purely conjecture. </p>",

They regard their lives as an eternal struggle to best themselves and each other. Each elemental type is uniquely suited to adapting to conditions on its particular plane, and is arrogant about its powers when surrounded by its element... and uniquely frightened and cowed when shown a greater power or encased in an element not its own. Most elementals do not bargain for favors&mdash;they respect only strength. Genies are the more human-like denizens of the elemental planes, both in shape and mentality. They consider themselves physically and culturally superior  to true elementals.</p><p>In general, one summons an elemental for brute work and combat, and a genie for magical power or ancient wisdom, and would thus use <i>summon monster</i> and <i>planar binding</i> for those tasks, respectively. However, should a conjurer wish to bind an elemental as he would a genie or fiend, the ritual is one of wrestling with the elemental's creativity in reaching its home element. Elementals are immune to bleed, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning. They are not subject to critical hits, precision-based attacks like sneak attack, or flanking. </p><p>Genies seek and value power, though they are more brash and boastful than most. It is said the best way to secure the attentions of a genie is to speak its true name, and to offer it aid in battles against its political enemies&mdash;a wise conjurer researches the inner battles of geniekind before summoning a genie, or else is prepared to cow the genie with strong magic.</p>",

When you design a spell, you have to take those power levels into account by comparing the new spell to existing spells&mdash;a spell has to fall into the narrow range of power for one of the nine spell levels (plus cantrips or orisons). In contrast, prices for magic items are strongly granular, and are calculated to the gold piece based on precisely what features the item possesses. In other words, if you add more power to a magic item, you just increase its price to compensate, but if you add too much power to a spell, you have to make it a higher-level spell, which means you then have to compare it to a different set of example spells.</p>",

However, there's a reason there aren't as many sonic spells in the game: &ldquo;sonic&rdquo; as an energy type is a late addition to the rules, and very few monsters have any resistance to sonic damage because most monsters existed before &ldquo;sonic&rdquo; was defined as an energy type. Because there are fewer creatures with sonic resistance than creatures with fire resistance, <i>sonic screech</i> will almost always be a better spell than <i>burning hands</i>. That means if you introduce <i>sonic screech</i> into your game, you'll see savvy players selecting it instead of <i>burning hands</i>. If a new spell displaces an existing spell from the roster of most spellcasters, it probably means it's better than the other available choices&mdash;and if it's so good that it's obviously the best spell choice, it's probably overpowered.

However, the slight decrease in power from making a spell &ldquo;caster-only&rdquo; should not be used to justify designing the spell at a lower level. In most cases, the caster-only spells are designed that way either because they've always worked that way, or because they provide a bonus that is unique and advantageous for that class, but that could get out of hand if you allowed anyone to get the benefit of the spell by casting it on them or drinking a potion of that spell; these spells should remain caster-only, but you should examine their power level as if you could cast them on anyone.</p>",

A burst effect like <i>fireball</i> can potentially affect many more enemies than a pick-your-targets spell like <i>slow</i>, but you never risk hitting your friends when you use <i>slow</i>.

This is because arcane magic is deliberately designed to be better at dealing damage to balance the fact that divine magic is better at healing. A &ldquo;single target&rdquo; spell only damages one creature (like <i>shocking grasp</i>), or divides its damage among several creatures (like <i>burning hands</i> or <i>magic missile</i>). A &ldquo;multiple target&rdquo; spell applies its full damage to several creatures (like <i>fireball</i>).</p><p>For example, a 1st-level single-target wizard spell like <i>shocking grasp</i> can deal a maximum of 5 dice of damage (specifically 5d6). <i>Magic missile</i> can be used against a single target, or the caster can split up the missiles to affect multiple creatures, dividing the single-target damage among them. <i>Burning hands</i> initially looks like it doesn't obey the damage cap table because it deals multiple dice of damage against multiple creatures, but this is offset by the fact that it only deals d4s instead of d6s, and it has an extremely close and limited area of effect.</p><p>When looking at the Maximum Damage tables, also keep in mind that arcane spells usually use d6s for damage and divine spells usually use d8s, and these tables assume d6s; when looking at the damage caps for divine spells, count each d8 as 2d6. Thus, <i>searing light</i> is a 3rd-level single-target cleric spell that deals up to 5d8 points of damage; treating each d8 as 2d6, that counts as 10d6, which is on target for a 3rd-level cleric spell.

Requiring the caster to touch a target with a hostile spell means the caster is in or very close to melee combat, and is risking retaliation from enemies and attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents. Similarly, while close-range spells give the caster a little more breathing room, a hostile target is generally within the range of a single move or a charge, allowing an opponent to close and attack the caster&mdash;even at caster level 14, a close-range spell only reaches 60 feet.</p><p>In indoor situations, most medium-range combat spells may as well have an infinite range, because at the level the caster gains access to the spell, the caster can reach 150 feet or more, and few encounters deal with ranges that far&mdash;the caster can hit anything he can see. Even outdoors, a spell with a 150-foot range can hit anything in sight on a typical game mat like a Paizo GameMastery Flip-Mat (24 inches by 30 inches is 120 feet by 150 feet). Long range is likewise all-encompassing, with a 400-foot minimum range translating to almost 7 feet on a game mat&mdash;longer than many tables used for gaming. Long range only comes into play in abstract situations like launching a <i>fireball</i> at enemies across a large prairie, using <i>dimension door</i> to return to an earlier (and safer) part of the dungeon, and so on.</p><p>Obviously, touch-range spells are the weakest type of spell, close-range spells are better but not extremely so, and medium- and long-range spells may as well be identical for most purposes. Given that the Enlarge Spell feat doubles a spell's range at a cost of +1 spell level, and the Reach Spell feat increases the range by one category (from touch to close, close to medium, medium to long), at a cost of +1 spell level, it's reasonable to balance a spell by assuming a +1 increase in level corresponds to increasing the range category by one. For example, a spell that works like <i>cure light wounds</i> (normally 1st level) at close range instead of touch is appropriate for a 2nd-level spell.</p>",

                    "body": "<p>Whether or not spell resistance applies to a spell depends mostly on whether or not it is an instantaneous or ongoing magical effect. Spell resistance applies to instantaneous magical effects (such as <i>fireball</i>) and ongoing magical effects (such as <i>wall of fire</i>), but not to nonmagical effects or spells that create nonmagical effects, whether instantaneous or ongoing. For example, <i>wall of stone</i> conjures an instantaneous wall of stone that cannot be dispelled; spell resistance doesn't help you walk through the spell's wall any more than it would if you tried to walk through a mortared stone wall in a castle&mdash;neither wall is magical, and both walls remain there even if you use <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>antimagic field</i> on them.</p><p>The general rule is that most spells allow spell resistance. Only when you're deliberately designing a spell that creates a nonmagical object or nonmagical effect is spell resistance likely to be irrelevant. You can use <i>move earth</i> (instantaneous duration) to create a hill, and spell resistance won't help you get over or through the hill because the spell moves the earth and thereafter stops being magical; likewise, you can use <i>move earth</i> to create a pit, and spell resistance won't help you ignore the pit because it's a nonmagical pit, just as if you had created it with a shovel. <i>Magic stone</i> adds magical power to stones, but spell resistance doesn't help protect against being hit by the stones any more than spell resistance helps protect against a <i>+1 arrow</i> because the magic is focused on the stones, not on the creature with spell resistance.</p><p>It's a common trick to design a spell that doesn't allow spell resistance so the caster can use it against creatures who have spell resistance. In many cases, the idea behind the design is just silly, like a spell that creates a sphere of burning oil and hurls it at the intended area, where it bursts in an explosion of flame; clearly the intent is to create a nonmagical <i>fireball</i> that bypasses spell resistance. Golems in particular are often the intended targets of these spell designs, as their immunity to magic ability makes them completely immune to any effect that allows spell resistance. You should avoid letting these sorts of trick spells into your campaign, as they meddle with the balance of encounters (some monsters are designed to be harder for melee characters to fight, some are designed to be harder for spellcasters to fight, and some are just supposed to be difficult all around).</p><p>Whether or not a spell allows spell resistance is not an indicator of the spell's power; for most encounters, spell resistance isn't a factor.</p><p>If a spell's saving throw entry is marked as &ldquo;(harmless)&rdquo; or &ldquo;(object),&rdquo; the spell resistance entry should say that as well.</p>",

Making combat spells with faster casting times devalues the Quicken Spell feat; even if you design the spell to be similar to a quickened spell, including the +4 level boost, it steals from casters who actually learn that feat, and your spell would become a common combo for high-level casters who can afford extra spells of that level. For example, if you create a 5th-level quickened <i>magic missile</i> spell that acts just like a <i>magic missile</i> spell with the Quicken Spell feat, any 14th-level wizard (who has at least three 5th-level spells available) is going to be tempted to learn this spell just because it allows him to add 5d4+5 extra points of damage to any high-level combat spell he casts, which is a way to get around the spell-damage cap. Furthermore, allowing spellcasters to routinely cast two spells per round means they tend to use up their spells more quickly and push their allies to camp and rest rather than continue exploring.</p><p>Spells that summon creatures to help in combat should have a casting time of &ldquo;1 round.&rdquo; This is to give a reasonable action cost for a character casting the spell. If the caster could summon a monster using a standard action and have it act that same round, it's like the spell didn't cost him any actions at all.</p><p>Spells that call an outsider to serve for more than a few rounds (such as <i>planar ally</i> and <i>planar binding</i>) should have a casting time of 10 minutes; more powerful spells may have even longer casting times. Note that <i>gate</i> can be used to call creatures and only has a casting time of 1 standard action, but when used this way, it requires a 10,000 gp material component, so that faster casting time doesn't come cheaply.</p>",

Most spells have verbal and somatic components, and new spells should follow this trend.</p><p>The advantage of spells that don't require verbal components is they can be cast in an area of <i>silence</i>, and thus there is the temptation to create silent versions of common combat spells. However, doing so devalues the Silent Spell feat, just like making swift-action spells devalues Quicken Spell, though not to such a great extent (casting two spells per round is a more serious problem than having a backup spell to counteract an unexpected <i>silence</i>). If casters decide they'd rather prepare a silent<i> magic missile</i> instead of <i>acid arrow</i>, or a silent<i> acid arrow</i> instead of <i>fireball</i>, they've deliberately chosen weaker options, and that's fine.</p><p>The advantage of spells that don't require somatic components is they can be cast when bound, grappled, or when both hands are full or occupied, and arcane spell failure doesn't apply. Just as creating silent versions of spells devalues Silent Spell, making non-somatic spells devalues the Still Spell feat. The premise of the game is that most spells require words and gestures, and new spells should stick with that unless the theme of the spell suggests it wouldn't require a somatic component, or it was specifically designed to escape bindings or grapples.</p><p>The advantage of spells that don't require material components is they don't require a spell component pouch (and in the rare circumstance in which if you're grappled, you needn't already have your material components in hand to cast the spell). Most material components are part of a spell for flavor rather than to satisfy rules. The guano and sulfur material components of <i>fireball</i> are there because early gunpowder (black powder) was made from guano and sulfur. The fur and glass rod material components of <i>lightning bolt</i> come from the ability to create a buildup of static electricity by rubbing fur against a glass rod. The game could present those spells without material components at all, and it would have a negligible effect on how the game plays (as proven by the &ldquo;it has whatever I need&rdquo; spell component pouch, and the sorcerer class getting Eschew Materials as a bonus feat)&mdash;they're just in the spell for fun. Balance your spell assuming it has no material components or free material components, and then add them in if the flavor seems appropriate.</p><p>Costly material components should be used to prevent overzealous players from casting the spell as often as they want, because the spell either makes adventuring too easy if everyone in the party has it (such as <i>stoneskin</i>), allows the PCs to bypass key adventuring experiences like exploring and investigating (such as <i>augury</i>, <i>divination</i>, and <i>commune</i>), or allows the PCs to trivialize certain threats (such as <i>raise dead</i> and <i>restoration</i>). Balance a spell without costly material components if possible, usually by raising the spell level if it is too good for the intended level. Sometimes the power level of a spell is on target (like <i>augury</i>, as it makes sense to have a low-level divination spell for clerics), but the spell is valuable enough that players will overuse it if it's free, so you have to apply a gp cost to moderate how often the PCs use it. Long-lasting defensive spells such as <i>glyph of warding</i> also fit into this category; if they were free, every spellcaster would cover her lair in them, casting one per day for the weeks or months of planning the NPC has before the PCs arrive. By giving <i>glyph of warding</i> a gp cost, it allows for more traditional adventuring&mdash;otherwise every square the PCs walk on is a potential trap, slowing play to a crawl as the PCs are forced to slowly and carefully search every square to notice the glyphs (given that a typical 5th-level rogue has +14 to Perception against a DC 28 glyph, meaning she fails most searches unless she takes 20).</p><p>Focus components are governed by the same rules as material components&mdash;in most cases they're just there for flavor, and are only relevant if costly. A costly focus is like a costly material component, except it's a one-time expenditure rather than a repeat expenditure, a barrier to entry that you can ignore once you've crossed the threshold. A costly focus is a good way to delay when PCs gain access to the spell, but once they have the materials, it's essentially just like any other spell without a costly focus. As with material components, balance the spell for its level, and if it seems like the spell is too good and delaying access to it would help moderate it, consider adding a costly focus component.</p>",

Remember that players are going to refer to the spell description in a hurry during their turn of combat, and if they have to fight their way through flowery language to figure out the details, the resulting delay will annoy other players and the GM. If the spell has several complex effects, put each effect into its own paragraph. If the spell allows the caster to choose from several options, put each option on its own line with an italicized name (see <i>binding</i> for an example).</p><p>Anything that appears in the spell stat block doesn't need to appear again in the spell description&mdash;it's redundant. For example, the <i>fireball</i> description doesn't say, &ldquo;The spell can reach up to 400 feet plus 40 feet per caster level.&rdquo; Extraneous text like that is just more clutter for the player to sift through when looking up the spell's effects in the middle of combat.</p><p>Avoid using language that implies something that the game mechanics of the spell don't back up. For example, a spell's description shouldn't say &ldquo;using the foul powers of necromancy&rdquo; if the spell doesn't actually have some sort of evil effect or the evil descriptor. This sort of mistake is most common with necromancy spells, which include not only many obviously evil spells, but also a fair share of helpful ones as well (such as <i>astral projection</i>, <i>gentle repose</i>, and <i>undeath to death</i>). People who read your spell description may not know your intent, and using flavorful language can trick readers into thinking a spell should have additional effects not explicitly spelled out in the description.</p><p>Remember that while you may be designing a spell with a particular character or class in mind, most spells are going to have a broader availability. You have to think of the spell in the hands of the biggest power gamer, and in use by a character who is very different than the one for whom it is designed. Even a simple sorcerer/wizard spell has to deal with two different types of casters: a wizard, who can learn many spells but can only cast a few per day, and a sorcerer, who knows few spells but can cast many per day. A spell that is good for a wizard may be too good when used by a sorcerer because the sorcerer can use it more times per day. Likewise, think of what happens if the PCs can access the spell in potion or scroll form&mdash;you may intend for the spell to be rare and for the PCs to not have it most of the time, but a wizard can create scrolls of rarely used spells and save them for just the right opportunity.</p><p>When you finish writing a spell description, have others look it over. They'll notice things you missed, come up with questions your spell needs to address, and find ways your spell can be abused. Use that feedback to revise the spell.</p>",

Hit points, ability scores, and levels are all depletable statistics&mdash;a creature falls unconscious below 0 hit points and eventually dies; objects, undead, and constructs are destroyed at 0 hit points; creatures are made helpless or killed by bringing an ability score to 0; creatures die when their negative levels equal their total Hit Dice. Many magical attacks and most nonmagical attacks reduce a target's depletable statistics in some way, eventually defeating the target. However, attack bonuses, saving throw bonuses, Armor Class, hardness, CMB, CMD, initiative, speed, skill modifiers, and most other game statistics are not depletable statistics because no matter how low these statistics get, the affected creature or object is still able to take actions. For example, a spell that gives a target a &ndash;10 attack penalty has little effect on a sorcerer casting <i>fireball</i>, as would a spell that gave her a &ndash;10 penalty on her Wisdom saving throw; despite her poor attack rolls and miserable Will saves, she is still quite capable of blasting her opponents to bits, whether these penalties are &ndash;10 or &ndash;100. Similarly, a fighter with a &ndash;10 penalty on Fortitude saving throws can still swing a sword, as can one with a &ndash;10 penalty to Armor Class; the fighter is still viable despite these penalties. &ldquo;Depletable statistic&rdquo; isn't an official game term, but it is a helpful concept when comparing power levels of spells&mdash;attacking depletable statistics is a war of attrition that can eventually wear down the target, whereas adding penalties to non-depletable statistics may have no effect at all, as the target may have other attacks that allow them to ignore those penalties.</p>",

This is the best kind of attack spell because not only does it negate an opponent (the same effect as a kill or incapacitate spell), but it also creates a new ally that the caster can turn against his other opponents. Many of the more powerful enchantment spells are control spells, though their drawback is that they tend to be all-or-nothing (if the creature saves, it's completely unaffected by the spell).

Kill spells are better than incapacitate spells because they don't wear off and there's no chance another enemy can easily reverse the spell (such as with <i>dispel magic</i>).

Spells that cause an enemy to flee count as incapacitate spells. Incapacitate spells are better than damage spells because they allow the caster to bypass a target's depletable statistics, sometimes disabling an opponent with a single spell.

Damage spells are reliable spells because all creatures have depletable statistics of some sort and because most nonmagical attacks affect depletable statistics (which means that the caster's fighter and rogue allies are helping overcome the opponent). Damage spells are better than penalize spells because damage always stacks (penalties do not) and if the caster and his allies deal enough damage, they'll eventually disable an opponent, whereas it's possible to add penalties almost indefinitely and still have a somewhat viable opponent. Examples of damage spells are <i>cone of cold</i>, <i>fireball</i>, <i>lightning bolt</i>, <i>magic missile</i>, <i>poison</i>, and <i>sound burst</i>.</p>",

Penalize spells are the weakest sort of spells because in most cases the caster can't kill an opponent with penalties and the penalties don't stack with themselves, so the caster and his allies have to deal with the penalized opponent in some other way (typically through damage spells and nonmagical attacks). Examples of penalize spells are <i>bane</i>, <i>blindness/deafness</i>, <i>ray of enfeeblement</i>, and <i>slow</i>.</p><p>There are exceptions to the above categories. For example, if dealing with a monster that has a lot of hit points and deals substantial damage but only has a moderate chance of harming the caster's allies, the caster may be better off trying to give the opponent an attack penalty (to decrease the chance of the monster hitting) than trying to wear down its hit points (because during that time the monster may be dealing a lot of damage to the caster's allies). In this case, a penalize spell that reduces its attack bonus is better than a damage spell. As another example, the PCs may need to question a defeated opponent, in which case an incapacitate spell is a better choice than a kill spell (unless the PCs have some really good magic that lets them question the dead more effectively than <i>speak with dead</i>).</p><p>Spells with variable effects may be more than one type of spell in the hierarchy depending on the results&mdash;a <i>confusion</i> spell that causes a monster to babble incoherently is an incapacitate spell, but if the spell causes it to attack one of its allies, it's a control spell. Likewise, a <i>summon monster III</i> spell that summons a fiendish constrictor snake is an incapacitate spell if the snake grapples an enemy, but it's just a damage spell if it summons a fiendish boar, which only deals damage and has no special attacks. Balancing these spells is tricky, as you have to consider their optimal usage.</p>",
