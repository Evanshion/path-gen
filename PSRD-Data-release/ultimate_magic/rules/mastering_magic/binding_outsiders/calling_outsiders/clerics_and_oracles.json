    "body": "<p>Clerics and oracles find the job of summoning and binding outsiders much easier than arcane spellcasters do. A cleric calls upon her deity to send a like-minded creature by way of one of the <i>planar ally</i> spells. That outsider is in the service of the god, and its desires almost always align with the cleric's goals, or at least run in parallel with them.</p><p>The cleric must bargain with the deity's servant for a payment agreed upon before the outsider will perform the task: gold, magic items, gifts, sacrifices, or promises by the cleric to achieve certain goals particular to the conjured ally. The greater the task, the greater the payment required, with a minimum of 100 gp worth of goods or services, sometimes extending into the thousands&mdash;and sometimes the ally simply refuses the cleric's binding if the job is too dangerous or beneath its dignity.</p>",
