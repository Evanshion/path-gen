    "body": "<p id=\"draconal-(sr-31)\">Powerful, haughty, and removed from mortal affairs, these direct agents of the gods are often aggravating to deal with once bound. Patient pursuers of long-term plans, many draconals seek to wait out mortal spellcasters rather than bargain for their services. Those who wish to bind and use the power of a draconal must be epically powerful and have perfect timing, know the draconal's true name, or be lucky enough to have plans running in concert with the agathion's goals. </p>",
