Negotiations often devolve into the star archon blasting his binder for shortsightedness and wasting the archon's time. Star archons demand outrageous gifts even when the cause is just. Only when the archon's and the binder's goals work in close concert are the gifts the archon demands nearly attainable. </p>",
