To gain their favor, one must prove worthy of their presence; rather than making offerings of things, trumpet archons ask for sacrifices of service and time, and any binder who offers an exchange of services&mdash;and intends to keep her word&mdash;gains a +2 Charisma bonus. Those who renege on their bonds see their fortunes begin to vanish, and take a &ndash;2 Charisma penalty when dealings with good extraplanar creatures until they set matters right.</p>",
