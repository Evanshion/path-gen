These constructs are in many ways weaker than manufactured constructs, as they are susceptible to dispelling and antimagic.</p><p>A caster can use the <i>animate objects</i> spell to instantly create a temporary construct. A <i>permanency</i> spell cast upon an animated object makes the construct permanent; however, it can still be dispelled or suppressed by antimagic. Craft Construct creates permanent animated objects not susceptible to dispelling and antimagic. The CR of a potential animated object depends on its size and abilities, as explained in the animated object entry.</p>",
