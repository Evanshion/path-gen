    "body": "<p id=\"cone-of-cold\">This spell is an interesting benchmark because it's actually a weak spell for its level; at the level you gain it, <i>fireball</i> does just as much damage and at a longer range, and <i>cone of cold</i>'s damage cap is only 5 dice higher than <i>fireball</i>. If your 5th-level attack spell is weaker than this spell, you should increase its power or consider making it a 4th-level spell.</p>",
