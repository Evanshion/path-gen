    "body": "<p>When designing a new spell, you should always compare it to the existing spells to get a sense of whether the spell is strong or weak for its level. This is because if a spell pushes the boundaries of what's acceptable or balanced, even just by a little bit, it's easy to push the boundaries a little more with your new spell, which means that over time, new spells end up more and more powerful compared to the existing spells.</p><p>Remember that it's acceptable to make a spell that isn't as powerful as an existing spell. Just because it's not the best spell of its level doesn't mean it won't get used by adventurers. In fact, that's why easily crafted scrolls are a significant part of the game&mdash;to allow parties access to spells they wouldn't normally prepare or learn, but may find useful in some circumstances.</p>",
