    "body": "<p>Low-level damage spells are not as good as medium- or high-level damage spells&mdash;the game is designed so lower-level spells eventually reach a maximum amount of damage they can deal. This is because if low-level spells continued to increase in damage without hitting a maximum amount, they'd rival some higher-level spells for effectiveness, and the game isn't as interesting if casters are using the same spells at 20th level as they were at 1st.</p><p>The maximum damage depends on the level of the spell and whether the spell is arcane or divine. This is because arcane magic is deliberately designed to be better at dealing damage to balance the fact that divine magic is better at healing. A &ldquo;single target&rdquo; spell only damages one creature (like <i>shocking grasp</i>), or divides its damage among several creatures (like <i>burning hands</i> or <i>magic missile</i>). A &ldquo;multiple target&rdquo; spell applies its full damage to several creatures (like <i>fireball</i>).</p><p>For example, a 1st-level single-target wizard spell like <i>shocking grasp</i> can deal a maximum of 5 dice of damage (specifically 5d6). <i>Magic missile</i> can be used against a single target, or the caster can split up the missiles to affect multiple creatures, dividing the single-target damage among them. <i>Burning hands</i> initially looks like it doesn't obey the damage cap table because it deals multiple dice of damage against multiple creatures, but this is offset by the fact that it only deals d4s instead of d6s, and it has an extremely close and limited area of effect.</p><p>When looking at the Maximum Damage tables, also keep in mind that arcane spells usually use d6s for damage and divine spells usually use d8s, and these tables assume d6s; when looking at the damage caps for divine spells, count each d8 as 2d6. Thus, <i>searing light</i> is a 3rd-level single-target cleric spell that deals up to 5d8 points of damage; treating each d8 as 2d6, that counts as 10d6, which is on target for a 3rd-level cleric spell. (Note that the 1d6 per level and maximum 10d6 points of damage against undead are still correct for a spell of this level, and the slightly higher damage against light-vulnerable undead is offset by the reduced damage against constructs).</p>",
