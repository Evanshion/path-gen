    "body": "<p>The intended function is the most important consideration when designing a spell. Specifically, function refers to the tangible game effects of the spell, such as dealing damage, applying a condition such as sickened, or giving a bonus on saves or attack rolls. Everything else is cosmetic at this point&mdash;it doesn't matter if it's slashing damage or fire damage, makes a target sickened or confused, grants an insight bonus on saves or an enhancement bonus on attack rolls, or looks like unicorns or fire demons. Some sample functions include:</p><ul><li>\tDeal damage to one opponent</li><li>\tDeal damage to multiple opponents</li><li>\tApply a condition or effect to one opponent</li><li>\tApply a condition or effect to multiple opponents</li><li>\tGive a defensive bonus to one ally</li><li>\tGive a defensive bonus to multiple allies</li><li>\tGive an offensive bonus to one ally</li><li>\tGive an offensive bonus to multiple allies</li><li>\tHeal one ally</li><li>\tHeal multiple allies</li></ul><p>A spell can do several of these things at once, or give the caster a choice between several options, but such spells should always be less powerful than a single-purpose spell of the same spell level, so keep that in mind when designing the spell. Note that &ldquo;condition or effect&rdquo; is the broadest category in the above list, which includes actual conditions like sickened and panicked, as well as effects like teleportation. </p>",
