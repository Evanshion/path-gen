    "body": "<p id=\"control\">A control spell puts an opponent under your control, turning him into an ally or at least keeping him from being an active enemy for a while. This is the best kind of attack spell because not only does it negate an opponent (the same effect as a kill or incapacitate spell), but it also creates a new ally that the caster can turn against his other opponents. Many of the more powerful enchantment spells are control spells, though their drawback is that they tend to be all-or-nothing (if the creature saves, it's completely unaffected by the spell). Examples of control spells are <i>charm monster</i>, <i>charm person</i>, <i>confusion</i>, <i>dominate monster</i>, and <i>dominate person</i>.</p>",
