    "body": "<p id=\"incapacitate\">An incapacitate spell makes the target unable to act against the caster, effectively removing him from a battle for a period of time (possibly permanently) but at the risk of other opponents reversing the incapacitated target's condition. Spells that cause an enemy to flee count as incapacitate spells. Incapacitate spells are better than damage spells because they allow the caster to bypass a target's depletable statistics, sometimes disabling an opponent with a single spell. Examples of incapacitate spells are <i>fear</i>, <i>flesh to stone</i>, <i>hold monster</i>, <i>hold person</i>, <i>power word stun</i>, and <i>sleep</i>.</p>",
