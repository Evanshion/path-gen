    "body": "<p id=\"kill\">A kill spell kills or destroys an opponent outright, bypassing the target's depletable statistics (see sidebar), typically with a Fortitude saving throw. Kill spells are better than incapacitate spells because they don't wear off and there's no chance another enemy can easily reverse the spell (such as with <i>dispel magic</i>). The best of the kill spells still act as damage spells if the target saves, so the caster is guaranteed some effect. Examples of kill spells are <i>disintegrate</i>, <i>finger of death</i>, <i>phantasmal killer</i>, <i>power word kill</i>, <i>slay living</i>, and <i>wail of the banshee</i>.</p>",
