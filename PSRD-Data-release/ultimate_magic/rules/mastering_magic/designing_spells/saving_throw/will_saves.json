    "body": "<p id=\"will-saves\">Spells with Will saves are mental, mind-affecting attacks; the target resists with pure mental power, by using evasive thoughts or noticing flaws in the spell's assault that can negate its effectiveness. A Will save is like a mental version of a Fortitude save; the effect &ldquo;hits&rdquo; the target, and whether or not it succeeds depends on the target's willpower. Most direct-attack Will-save spells (such as <i>sleep</i> and <i>phantasmal killer</i>) are mind-affecting effects (see Descriptors, below).</p><p>Some spells can be cast on objects, and the object only gets a saving throw if it is a magic item or is held by a creature; these spells should have &ldquo;(object)&rdquo; listed after the type of saving throw (see <i>shrink item</i>).</p><p>Helpful spells and spells that do not harm the target in any way either should have no saving throw, or should allow a saving throw but have &ldquo;(harmless)&rdquo; listed after the type of saving throw (see <i>fly</i>).</p><p>Spells that only affect the caster never require a saving throw (you'd never try to resist a beneficial spell you're casting on yourself), so you don't list a saving throw for those spells at all (see <i>true strike</i>).</p>",
