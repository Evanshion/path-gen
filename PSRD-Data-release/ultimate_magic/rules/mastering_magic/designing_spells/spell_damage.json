    "body": "<p>One of the easiest ways to measure an offensive spell's power is to look at how much damage it does. Offensive spells are the easiest spells to design in the game, and there are dozens of examples of them. A typical damage spell deals 1 die of damage (typically a d6) per caster level for an arcane spell (for example, <i>shocking grasp</i> or <i>fireball</i>), or 1 die of damage (typically a d6, but sometimes a d8) per two caster levels for a divine spell (for example, <i>searing light</i>).</p>",
