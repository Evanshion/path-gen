Before designing a new spell, familiarize yourself with Magic. In particular, be sure you understand the various schools and subschools and the spell stat block categories (components, range, and so on).</p><p>The following sections address aspects of spell design in order of their importance and relevance to making a balanced spell. For example, the components of a spell have very little to do with its power level unless an expensive focus or material component is involved, so components are discussed well after damage, range, duration, and saving throws.</p>",
