    "body": "<p id=\"example\"><i>Shield</i> and <i>true strike</i> are both 1st-level spells that only affect the caster. If you could cast those spells on others, they'd still be at the right power level for 1st-level spells&mdash;they aren't 2nd-level spells that you knocked down a level because you designed them as caster-only. <i>Shield</i> has always been a spell that only affects the caster, and there's a game-balance reason to keep it that way: because <i>shield</i> grants a shield bonus, casting it on a melee character means the fighter could drop his actual shield and start wielding his weapon two-handed for extra damage. <i>True strike</i> was deliberately designed as a caster-only spell so a sorcerer couldn't just cast it every round on the fighter, who'd be guaranteed a hit against a difficult monster even if he used Combat Expertise (for extra AC) and Power Attack (for extra damage). Making those spells caster-only doesn't really weaken the spells, but it does prevent players from exploiting certain combinations that would make encounters too easy.</p><p>A spell that affects multiple creatures is more powerful than a spell that only affects one creature. Multiple-creature spells tend to either be area effects such as cones and spheres (like <i>fireball</i>), or allow the caster to select multiple targets as long as no two targets are more than a set distance apart (like <i>slow</i>). A burst effect like <i>fireball</i> can potentially affect many more enemies than a pick-your-targets spell like <i>slow</i>, but you never risk hitting your friends when you use <i>slow</i>. Select which type is most appropriate for the spell, but understand that selecting multiple targets is generally more powerful except at the lowest caster levels (where a low caster level means few targets compared to a burst which can affect many).</p>",
