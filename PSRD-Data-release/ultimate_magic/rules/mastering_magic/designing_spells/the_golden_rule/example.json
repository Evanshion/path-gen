    "body": "<p id=\"example\">If you look at the Spell Lists, you'll notice that there isn't a 1st-level wizard spell that deals sonic damage. You may decide to design a spell to fill that niche, modeling it after <i>burning hands</i>, except dealing sonic damage instead of fire&mdash;perhaps you'd call it <i>sonic screech</i>. However, there's a reason there aren't as many sonic spells in the game: &ldquo;sonic&rdquo; as an energy type is a late addition to the rules, and very few monsters have any resistance to sonic damage because most monsters existed before &ldquo;sonic&rdquo; was defined as an energy type. Because there are fewer creatures with sonic resistance than creatures with fire resistance, <i>sonic screech</i> will almost always be a better spell than <i>burning hands</i>. That means if you introduce <i>sonic screech</i> into your game, you'll see savvy players selecting it instead of <i>burning hands</i>. If a new spell displaces an existing spell from the roster of most spellcasters, it probably means it's better than the other available choices&mdash;and if it's so good that it's obviously the best spell choice, it's probably overpowered. Understanding the entire system of rules can help you avoid mistakes like this.</p>",
