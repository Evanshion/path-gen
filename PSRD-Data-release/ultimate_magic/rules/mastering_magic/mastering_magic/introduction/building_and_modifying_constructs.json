Those who devote their lives to unlocking the inner workings of animating magic have uncovered numerous new abilities with which to imbue their constructs, as well as strange new ways to utilize the constructs themselves. Learn new animated object abilities, as well as how to price, modify, and repair unique constructs. Or dive deeper into more complex modifications: give your golem a brain to store feats, wear it as armor, see through its eyes, inscribe a rune on its forehead to protect it, or turn its limbs into grenades ready to shatter and splash liquid death over those who attack it.</p>",
