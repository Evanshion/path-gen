    "body": "<p>As with all scholarly practices, wizards and other arcane casters who follow an academic course to power achieve greatness by standing on the shoulders of giants. Presented in this section are numerous unique spellbooks ready to be dropped in front of arcane adventurers as treasure, or perhaps sought out as the objects of scholarly quests. In addition to spell lists and brief descriptions of each book's theme, these listings also include preparation rituals&mdash;boons a spellcaster can receive by preparing her spells using the spellbook in question. But beware, for not all of the spellcasters who penned these tomes take kindly to interlopers plagiarizing their work, and some spellbooks carry dangerous wards to defend their pages against prying eyes.</p>",
