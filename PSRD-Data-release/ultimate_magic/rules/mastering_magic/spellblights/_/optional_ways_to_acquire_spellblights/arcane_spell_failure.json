    "body": "<p id=\"arcane-spell-failure\">When a spellcaster fails an arcane failure check by rolling a 5% (a roll of 01&ndash;05 on the spell failure roll) or lower, she has a chance of becoming afflicted with a spellblight. The failed spellcaster must succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 15 + the spell's level) or gain a spellblight. A failed spell of 4th level or lower results in a minor spellblight, while a failed spell of 5th level or higher results in a major spellblight. </p>",
