    "body": "<p id=\"spell-turning\">When a spellcaster is warded with a <i>spell turning</i>, and so is the creature he or she attacks, such occurrences usually create a resonance field as described in the spell's description. Instead, the spellcaster who cast the original effect can choose not to create the resonance field and both spellcasters are affected by a major spellblight. The spell that triggered the resonance field drains away without effect.</p>",
