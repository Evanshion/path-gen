    "body": "<p id=\"eldritch-cataracts\">Each time a spellcaster with this spellblight casts a spell, her vision becomes fuzzier and fuzzier until eventually she is blinded. Each time the spellcaster casts a spell, she must succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 15 + the spell's level. If she fails, she takes a &ndash;1 penalty on vision-based Perception checks until the spellblight is removed. Further failed saving throws increase the penalty by 1 until the character reaches a &ndash;4 penalty, at which point she becomes blinded instead. </p><p>Eldritch cataracts is a difficult spellblight to cure. Any effect that cures blindness reduces the penalty by 1. If the penalty is reduced to &ndash;3 or lower, any blindness is relieved until the caster fails the Fortitude saving throw enough times to bring the penalty back to &ndash;4. Reducing the penalty to 0 cures the spellblight.</p><p>Blind creatures and creatures that don't use sight are immune to eldritch cataracts.</p>",
