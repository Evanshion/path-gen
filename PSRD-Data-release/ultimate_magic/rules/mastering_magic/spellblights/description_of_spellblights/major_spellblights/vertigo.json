    "body": "<p id=\"vertigo\">A spellcaster with vertigo becomes dizzy and lightheaded when she casts a spell. Each time she casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, the world spins and shifts around her. She must succeed at a concentration check (with a DC equal to the 15 + twice the level of the spell being cast). If the spellcaster fails the check, she falls prone, and for 1d4 rounds takes a penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, Ride, Stealth, and Swim checks equal to 1 + the level of the spell. While the afflicted spellcaster takes those penalties,  she must also succeed at a DC 10 Acrobatics check in order to stand up from prone. </p><p>A <i>restoration</i> cast on the afflicted spellcaster suppresses this spellblight for 1 day.</p>",
