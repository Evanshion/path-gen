{
    "body": "<p id=\"caster-croak\">The afflicted spellcaster's throat or mouth is magically constricted. The spellcaster can barely make her words heard, and then only with great effort. A creature under this affect can only make itself heard by others by spending a swift action to focus its will on speech. Casting spells with a verbal component has a 20% chance of spell failure, and the save DCs of any spells she casts with the language-dependent descriptor are reduced by 4. Spell-like abilities are not affected by this spellblight because they lack verbal components. Shouting and screaming is impossible while the creature is affected by this spellblight.</p><p>A <i>heal</i> spell or similar effect cures this spellblight, as does casting the <i>shout</i> spell, though doing so is still affected by the spellblight's effects.</p>",
