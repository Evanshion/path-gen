    "body": "<p id=\"eldritch-ague\">Eldritch ague manifests itself as a sickness that is debilitating to spellcasters. A spellcaster with this spellblight is sickened until the curse is removed. When the subject of the curse casts a spell, she is overcome with shaking for 1 round, requiring any spellcasting or the use of a spell-like ability during that time to succeed at a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell level of the spell being cast). If she fails the save, the spell and the action to cast it is lost.</p><p>While a curse, eldritch ague acts much like a disease, and creatures with immunity to disease are also immune to eldritch ague. <i>Remove disease</i> cures eldritch ague; unlike with most spellblights, using this spell to remove the spellblight does not impose a &ndash;5 caster level check penalty.</p>",
