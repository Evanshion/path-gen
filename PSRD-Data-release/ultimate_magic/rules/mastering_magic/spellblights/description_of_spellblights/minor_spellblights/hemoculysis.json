    "body": "<p id=\"hemoculysis\">A spellcaster with hemoculysis bleeds from her eyes whenever she casts a spell. The volume and duration of this flow depends on the level of the spell, lasting 1 round per level of the spell. While bleeding from the eyes, the spellcaster is considered dazzled and takes 1 point of bleed damage. Casting additional spells while the eyes are already bleeding resets the duration of existing hemoculysis by the spell level, provided it's greater than the current duration. The sight of the spellcaster's eyes bleeding is horrifying, and she gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks and a &ndash;4 penalty on Bluff and Diplomacy checks for the duration of the bleeding.</p><p>Hemoculysis can be cured by <i>heal</i> or <i>regenerate</i>.</p>",
