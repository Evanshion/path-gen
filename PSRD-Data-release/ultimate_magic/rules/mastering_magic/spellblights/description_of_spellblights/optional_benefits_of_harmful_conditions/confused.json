    "body": "<p id=\"confused\">While confused (either temporarily, or permanently by way of an <i>insanity</i> spell or effect), a spellcaster can tap into that confusion during periods of lucidity. When a confused spellcaster can act normally, the DCs of her spells that give confusion or insanity effects are increased by 1. The caster also gains a +2 competence bonus on caster level checks made to bypass spell resistance with those spells. </p>",
