Once per day, while disabled due to damage taken, a spellcaster can choose to treat a single conjuration (healing) spell she casts on herself as having a caster level two levels higher than her actual caster level. She must actually cast the spell; this ability cannot raise the caster level of a spell cast from a magic item. </p>",
