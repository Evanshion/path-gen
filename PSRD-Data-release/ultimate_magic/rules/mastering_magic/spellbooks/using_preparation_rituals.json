    "body": "<p>When a spellcaster who prepares spells uses a spellbook or formula book with a preparation ritual, as long as he prepares at least three spells (not including cantrips) or formulae from the spellbooks, he gains a temporary boon granted by the ritual. The boon lasts until its effect is spent (as specified by the boon description) or the spellcaster prepares spells again (at which time it can be reapplied by preparing at least three spells from the book). A spellcaster can only take the effect of one preparation ritual when she prepares spells, no matter how many spellbooks with preparation rituals she uses to prepare spells. Spells in this section A superscript &ldquo;S&rdquo; (<sup>S</sup>) indicates a spell from the caster's specialty school, whereas a superscript &ldquo;OP&rdquo; (<sup>OP</sup>) indicates a spell from the spellbook creator's opposition school.</p>",
