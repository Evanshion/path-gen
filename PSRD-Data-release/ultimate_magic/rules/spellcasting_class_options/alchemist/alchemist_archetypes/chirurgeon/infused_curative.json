    "body": "<p id=\"infused-curative\">At 2nd level, a chirurgeon's extracts of <i>cure</i> spells automatically act as infusions, and can be used by non-alchemists. When a chirurgeon prepares his extracts, he may choose to render any or all of his infused curatives inert and prepare other extracts to replace them (unlike infusions, which continue to occupy the alchemist's daily extract slots until consumed or used). This ability replaces poison use.</p>",
