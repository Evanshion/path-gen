    "body": "<p id=\"psychic-senses\">At 8th level, a psychonaut adds <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance</i>, <i>detect scrying</i>, <i>scrying</i>, and <i>speak with dead</i> to his formula book as 3rd-level extracts (a <i>scrying</i> extract does not require a focus or divine focus component). When a psychonaut uses a <i>speak with dead</i> extract, he gains the power to hear the lingering spirit within a corpse rather than enabling the corpse to audibly speak, but the extract otherwise works as the spell. This ability replaces poison resistance +6.</p>",
