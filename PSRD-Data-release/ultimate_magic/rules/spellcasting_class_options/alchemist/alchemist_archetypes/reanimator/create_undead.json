    "body": "<p id=\"create-undead\">At 13th level, a reanimator adds <i>create undead</i> to his formula book as a 4th-level extract. When he uses that extract, rather than drinking it, he injects it into the corpse he intends to animate, which rises as an uncontrolled undead 1 hour later. The extract can only create corporeal undead. This ability replaces the increase to bomb damage at this level.</p>",
