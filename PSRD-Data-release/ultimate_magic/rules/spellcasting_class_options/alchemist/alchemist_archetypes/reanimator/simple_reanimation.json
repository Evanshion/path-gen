    "body": "<p id=\"simple-reanimation\">At 7th level, a reanimator adds <i>lesser animate dead*</i> to his formula book as a 3rd-level extract. When he uses that extract, rather than drinking it, he injects it into the corpse he intends to animate, which rises as an undead creature under his control 1 hour later. The extract can only create zombies (including variant zombies). This ability replaces the increase to bomb damage at this level.</p>",
