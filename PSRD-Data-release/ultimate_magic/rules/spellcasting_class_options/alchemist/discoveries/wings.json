    "body": "<p id=\"wings\">The alchemist gains batlike, birdlike, or insectlike functional wings, allowing him to fly as the <i>fly</i> spell for a number of minutes per day equal to his caster level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. An alchemist can select this discovery multiple times; each time he does so, he adds his caster level to the number of minutes per day that he can fly with the wings. This flight is an extraordinary ability. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.</p>",
