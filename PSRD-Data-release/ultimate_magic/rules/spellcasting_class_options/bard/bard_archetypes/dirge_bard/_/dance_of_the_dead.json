    "body": "<p id=\"dance-of-the-dead\">At 10th level, a dirge bard can use his bardic performance to cause dead bones or bodies to rise up and move or fight at his command. This ability functions like <i>animate dead</i>, but the created skeletons or zombies remain fully animate only as long as the dirge bard continues the performance. Once it stops, any created undead collapse into carrion. Bodies or bones cannot be animated more than once using this ability. Unlike <i>animate dead</i>, dance of the dead requires no components and does not have the evil descriptor. This performance replaces jack-of-all-trades.</p>",
