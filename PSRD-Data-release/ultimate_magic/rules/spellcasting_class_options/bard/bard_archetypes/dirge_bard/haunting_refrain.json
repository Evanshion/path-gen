    "body": "<p id=\"haunting-refrain\">At 5th level, a dirge bard is able to stir primal terrors in the hearts of listeners. He can use a Perform (keyboard) or Perform (percussion) check in place of an Intimidate check to demoralize an opponent, with a bonus equal to half his bard level. In addition, saving throws against any fear effect he creates are made with a &ndash;2 penalty, and this penalty increases by &ndash;1 every 5 levels beyond 5th. This ability replaces lore master. </p>",
