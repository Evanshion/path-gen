    "body": "<p id=\"funereal-ballad\">A bard of 20th level or higher can use his performance to create an effect equivalent to <i>resurrection</i> on a dead creature, using the bard's level as the caster level. Using this ability requires 20 rounds of continuous performance, and the target must be within 10 feet of the bard for the entire performance. Funereal ballad relies on audible and visual components. This ability replaces deadly performance.</p>",
