    "body": "<p id=\"healing-performance\">A bard of 14th level or higher can use his performance to create an effect equivalent to <i>heal</i> on a living target (or <i>harm</i> on an undead target), using the bard's level as the caster level. Using this ability requires 5 rounds of continuous performance, and the target must be able to see and hear the bard throughout the performance. The healing performance relies on audible and visual components. This ability replaces frightening tune.</p>",
