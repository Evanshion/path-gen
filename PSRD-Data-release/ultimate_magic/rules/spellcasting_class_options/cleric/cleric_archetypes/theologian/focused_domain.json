    "body": "<p id=\"focused-domain\">A theologian chooses only one domain from her deity's portfolio rather than the normal two domains. All level-dependent effects of the granted powers from the theologian's domain function as if she were two cleric levels higher than her actual cleric level. This does not allow her to gain domain-granted powers earlier than normal. </p><p>A theologian can prepare domain spells using her non-domain slots. She cannot use her spontaneous casting ability on domain spells, even if they are prepared in non-domain slots. In all other respects, this works like and replaces the standard cleric domain ability.</p>",
