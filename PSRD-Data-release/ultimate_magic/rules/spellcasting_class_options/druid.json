Whether tapping the fundamental magic of the elements or relying on the teeth and claws of wild creatures to accomplish their goals, druids are forces to be reckoned with, and those whose actions threaten the wild places these nature folk hold dear had best be prepared to suffer the consequences.</p><p>The following section details new animal and terrain domains for druids, vermin companions for druids who don't want a more traditional animal companion, and new druid archetypes.</p>",
