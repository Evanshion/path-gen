    "body": "<p>Presented in the section below are new rules for animal and terrain domains&mdash;domains for druids whose focus is more specific than the Animal, Plant, Weather, or elemental domains. A druid with the nature's bond ability can choose an animal domain or terrain domain. Just like cleric domains, animal and terrain domains have granted powers and domain spells, and a druid who selects an animal or terrain domain gains a domain spell slot at each level. A druid who worships a deity (as opposed to nature in general) cannot select an animal or terrain domain that contradicts or is outside of the portfolio of her deity.</p><p>If an animal or terrain domain ability calls for a saving throw, the DC of the save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character's druid level + her Wisdom modifier.</p><p>Other nature-themed classes with access to domains may select an animal or terrain domain in place of a regular domain.</p>",
