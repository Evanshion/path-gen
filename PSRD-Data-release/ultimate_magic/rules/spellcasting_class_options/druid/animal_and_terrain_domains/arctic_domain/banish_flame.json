    "body": "<p id=\"banish-flame\">At 6th level, you may use your call cold ability to damage creatures with the fire subtype (as a cleric channeling negative energy) or to cause them to flee from you (as the Turn Undead feat). Alternatively, you may use this ability to negate magical fire effects as if using a targeted <i>dispel magic</i>; at 12th level, this functions as targeted or area <i>greater dispel magic</i> instead of <i>dispel magic</i>.</p>",
