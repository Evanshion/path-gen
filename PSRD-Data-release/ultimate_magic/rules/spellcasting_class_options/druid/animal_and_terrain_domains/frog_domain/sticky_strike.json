    "body": "<p id=\"sticky-strike\">As a standard action, you can attempt a ranged touch attack with a sticky tendril against a target up to 15 feet away, then use the pull universal monster ability to pull the target 5 feet toward you. You gain a bonus on the pull's combat maneuver check equal to 1/2 your druid level. If the target is larger than you, you may pull yourself 5 feet toward the target without making a check. The target can remove the tendril by making an opposed Strength check as a standard action, or by dealing enough slashing damage to the tendril (hit points equal to your druid level, Armor Class equal to your touch Armor Class). You can dissolve the tendril as a free action. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>",
