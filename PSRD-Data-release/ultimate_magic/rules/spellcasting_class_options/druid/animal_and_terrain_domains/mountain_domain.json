A foothold that is created on a horizontal surface is treated as difficult terrain, and a Medium or smaller creature standing in the area or moving through it takes a &ndash;2 penalty on Acrobatics checks and to CMD due to poor footing. A foothold that is created on a vertical surface grants a +10 bonus on Climb checks to climb it. The stone remains altered for 1 hour. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>",

A fatigued creature that begins its turn in the aura must save or suffer from altitude sickness, taking 1 point of ability damage to all ability scores. At 16th level, the aura increases to 10 feet. Creatures that do not breathe are immune to this aura. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your druid level; the rounds need not be consecutive.</p>",
