    "body": "<p id=\"foothold\">As a standard action, you can cause an adjacent stone surface up to 10 feet square to mold itself into ridges and creases. A foothold that is created on a horizontal surface is treated as difficult terrain, and a Medium or smaller creature standing in the area or moving through it takes a &ndash;2 penalty on Acrobatics checks and to CMD due to poor footing. A foothold that is created on a vertical surface grants a +10 bonus on Climb checks to climb it. The stone remains altered for 1 hour. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>",
