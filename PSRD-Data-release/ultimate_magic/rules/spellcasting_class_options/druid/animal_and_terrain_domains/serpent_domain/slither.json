You can move freely through a tight space that would normally require a creature of your size to squeeze through. While slithering, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity provoked by your movement and a +2 bonus on CMB and on Escape Artist checks made to escape from a grapple. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>",
