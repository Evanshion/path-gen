    "body": "<p id=\"totem-transformation\">At 2nd level, a dragon shaman may adopt an aspect of the dragon while retaining her normal form. She gains one of the following bonuses: movement (fly speed 30 feet [average], the druid must be 5th level to select this bonus), senses (low-light vision, +4 racial bonus to Perception), toughness (+2 natural armor bonus to AC, Endurance feat), or natural weapons (bite [1d6] and 2 claws [1d4] for a Medium shaman, +2 bonus on CMB on grapple checks). While using totem transformation, the dragon shaman may speak normally and can cast <i>speak with animals</i> (lizards only) at will. Using this ability is a standard action at 2nd level, a move action at 7th level, and a swift action at 12th level. The dragon shaman can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be used in 1-minute increments. This is a polymorph effect and cannot be used while the druid is using another polymorph effect, such as wild shape.</p>",
