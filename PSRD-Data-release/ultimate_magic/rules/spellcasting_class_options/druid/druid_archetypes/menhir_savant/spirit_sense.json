    "body": "<p id=\"spirit-sense\">At 1st level, a menhir savant can detect the presence of undead; fey; outsiders; and astral, ethereal, or incorporeal creatures. This ability functions like <i>detect undead</i>, and the druid detects all of these creatures rather than trying to detect one kind. This ability replaces nature sense and wild empathy.</p>",
