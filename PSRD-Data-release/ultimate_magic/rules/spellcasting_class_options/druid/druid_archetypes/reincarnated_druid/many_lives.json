    "body": "<p id=\"many-lives\">At 5th level, if a reincarnated druid is killed, she may automatically <i>reincarnate</i> (as the spell) 1 day later. The reincarnated druid appears in a safe location within 1 mile of her previous body. At will for the next 7 days, she can sense the presence of her remains as if using <i>locate object</i> as a spell-like ability. If she is killed during these 7 days, she remains dead and does not reincarnate. The many lives ability does not function ifthe reincarnated druid is slain by a death effect. A reincarnated druid cannot be raised from the dead or resurrected, though she can be reincarnated.</p>",
