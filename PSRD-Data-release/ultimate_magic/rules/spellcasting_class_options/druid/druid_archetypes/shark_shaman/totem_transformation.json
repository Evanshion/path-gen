    "body": "<p id=\"totem-transformation\">At 2nd level, a shark shaman may adopt an aspect of the shark while retaining her normal form. This ability functions as the dragon shaman's totem transformation ability, but the druid may select from the following bonuses: movement (can breathe water, swim speed 30 feet), senses (scent 30 feet, scent 90 feet in water), natural weapons (bite 1d6 for a Medium shaman), or shark skin (+2 natural armor, creatures grappling the shaman take 1 point of slashing damage per round of grapple). While using totem transformation, the shark shaman may speak normally and can cast <i>speak with animals</i> (fish only) at will. </p>",
