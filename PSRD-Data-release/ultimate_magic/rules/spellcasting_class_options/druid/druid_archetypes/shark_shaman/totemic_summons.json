    "body": "<p id=\"totemic-summons\">At 5th level, a shark shaman may use <i>summon nature's ally I</i> to summon a stingray and <i>summon nature's ally II</i> to summon a manta ray. She may cast <i>summon nature's ally</i> as a standard action when summoning rays and sharks, and summond rays and sharks gain a number of temporary hit points equal to her druid level. This ability otherwise functions as the dragon shaman's totemic summons ability.</p>",
