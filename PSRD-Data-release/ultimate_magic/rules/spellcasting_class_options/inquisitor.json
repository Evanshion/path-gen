But this is merely the most dramatic aspect of the inquisitor. Her world is filled with secret knowledge, constant danger, and strange mortal and outsider politics. The inquisitor's path has many branches and specializations, each with its own methods for rooting out and vanquishing enemies of the faith.</p><p>An inquisitor has a class ability that gives her access to one of her deity's domains; this access is one way to tune an inquisitor's abilities to fit the deity's interests. However, because an inquisitor only gets the granted powers of a domain and not its spells, some domains are poor choices for an inquisitor because they rely on cleric class abilities that inquisitors don't get. For example, the Sun domain's 1st-level granted power augments the effects of channel energy, but inquisitors don't have the channel energy ability, so they gain no benefit from their domain selection until 8th level, when they get a second granted power.</p><p>To remedy that problem, this section introduces inquisitions&mdash;new, specialized domainlike class features for inquisitors that grant abilities appropriate to their deity's portfolio. Following the inquisitions are new inquisitor archetypes.</p>",

These divine pursuits, called inquisitions, grant inquisitors the tools necessary for the fight against enemies of the faith. An inquisitor may select an inquisition in place of a domain.</p><p>If an inquisition's granted power calls for a saving throw, the DC of the save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character's inquisitor level + her Wisdom modifier. Unless otherwise stated, the caster level for granted power spell-like abilities is equal to the inquisitor's class level.</p><p>Inquisitions are intended for inquisitors, not for other classes that give access to domains. While a cleric or other domain-using class can select an inquisition in place of a domain (if appropriate to the character's deity), inquisitions do not grant domain spell slots or domain spells, and therefore are much weaker choices for those classes. These other classes use the appropriate class level as their inquisitor level for the purpose of inquisition granted powers (clerics use their cleric level as their inquisitor level, and so on).</p>",
