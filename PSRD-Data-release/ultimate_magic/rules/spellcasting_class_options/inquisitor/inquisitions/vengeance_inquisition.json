A mishap or an accident appropriate to the environment occurs, such as a branch falling on the creature, rocks falling from the ceiling, or some other nonmagical misfortune; regardless of the cause, the mishap deals 1d6 points of damage + 1 point for every two inquisitor levels you possess (Reflex half). The GM decides whether this damage is bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p>",
