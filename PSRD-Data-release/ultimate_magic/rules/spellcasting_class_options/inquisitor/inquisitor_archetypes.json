She does not need the enemy's corpse to use this ability (she can eat sin, move away from the corpse, then use <i>speak with dead</i>), though the soul gets a saving throw just as a corpse would.

The effect to be transferred is chosen by the sin eater and affects her as if she were the original target, continuing its duration (if any) and preventing any further effect on the original bearer. For example, the inquisitor could transfer a lethal disease to herself, or petrify herself to restore a petrified comrade. The sin eater can use this ability as often as desired, even using it multiple times on the same creature. This ability replaces exploit weakness.</p>",
