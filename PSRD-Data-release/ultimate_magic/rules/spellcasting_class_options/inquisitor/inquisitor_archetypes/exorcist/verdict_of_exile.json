    "body": "<p id=\"verdict-of-exile\">At 16th level, an inquisitor using judgment can unleash the verdict of exile on a creature. When she does, her judgment ends, but the creature subject to that judgment is dazed for 1 round (Will negates, DC of 10 + 1/2 inquisitor level + Wisdom bonus). If the creature is possessed or an outsider, the possessing entity or the outsider is affected by <i>dismissal</i> (Will negates). This ability replaces third judgment.</p>",
