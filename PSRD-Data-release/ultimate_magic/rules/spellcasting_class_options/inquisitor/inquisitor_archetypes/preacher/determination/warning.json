The ally must be able to hear the preacher and must not be helpless for this ability to have any effect.</p><p>Whenever the preacher could select a bonus teamwork feat (at 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level), she can instead choose to increase her number of uses per day of this ability by one. This ability replaces solo tactics.</p>",
