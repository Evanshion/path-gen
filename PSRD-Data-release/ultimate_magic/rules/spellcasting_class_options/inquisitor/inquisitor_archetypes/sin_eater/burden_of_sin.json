    "body": "<p id=\"burden-of-sin\">At 14th level, a sin eater may spend a full-round action to transfer one harmful affliction, condition, or spell effect from another creature to herself (this includes curses, possessions, and permanent effects such as petrification, or any condition that <i>break enchantment</i> can end or reverse). The effect to be transferred is chosen by the sin eater and affects her as if she were the original target, continuing its duration (if any) and preventing any further effect on the original bearer. For example, the inquisitor could transfer a lethal disease to herself, or petrify herself to restore a petrified comrade. The sin eater can use this ability as often as desired, even using it multiple times on the same creature. This ability replaces exploit weakness.</p>",
