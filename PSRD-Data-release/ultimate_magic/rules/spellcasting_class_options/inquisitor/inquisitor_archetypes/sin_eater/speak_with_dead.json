    "body": "<p id=\"speak-with-dead\">At 6th level, when the inquisitor eats an enemy's sins, within 10 minutes of doing so, she can ask the remnants of the enemy's soul questions as if using <i>speak with dead</i>, with a caster level equal to her inquisitor level. She does not need the enemy's corpse to use this ability (she can eat sin, move away from the corpse, then use <i>speak with dead</i>), though the soul gets a saving throw just as a corpse would. This ability replaces the bonus teamwork feat gained at 6th level.</p>",
