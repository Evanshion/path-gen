    "body": "<p>A <i>black blade</i> is a particular form of intelligent weapon gained by a magus with the bladebound archetype. There are several ways a magus might gain this weapon. Sometimes it just appears among the magus's possessions, and its origin is a mystery. Other times the magus finds a <i>black blade</i> during an adventure or event of some kind. Sometimes a <i>black blade</i> is passed down generation to generation in an ongoing search for a magus who can unlock its true potential. A <i>black blade</i> is always a one-handed slashing weapon, a rapier, or a sword cane. The magus chooses the blade's type upon gaining the blade, and once chosen, it can't be changed. As a bladebound magus increases in level, his <i>black blade</i> gains power. <i>A black blade</i> is independently conscious but features some personality traits reflecting its wielder. A <i>black blade</i> always has the same alignment as its wielder and even changes its alignment if its wielder does. The blade typically works toward its wielder's goals, but not always without argument or backlash. Each <i>black blade</i> has a mission, and while sometimes two or more <i>black blades</i> will work in concert, each mission is singular in purpose (the <i>black blade</i>'s mission is usually up to the GM and the needs of the campaign or the adventure, or a GM can roll randomly for the weapon's purpose using the Intelligent Item Purpose table. Some <i>black blades</i> are very open about their missions, but most are secretive. Certain sages have speculated that an invisible hand or arcane purpose moves these weapons.</p>",
