    "body": "<p id=\"transfer-arcana\">At 13th level, once per day, a magus can attempt to siphon points from his <i>black blade</i>'s arcane pool into his own arcane pool. Doing so takes a full-round action and the magus must succeed at a Will saving throw with a DC equal to the <i>black blade</i>'s ego. If the magus succeeds, he regains 1 point to his arcane pool for every 2 points he saps from his <i>black blade</i>. If he fails the saving throw, the magus becomes fatigued (but can try again). If he is fatigued, he becomes exhausted instead. He cannot use this ability if he is exhausted.</p>",
