In cases where a wielder and the <i>black blade</i> come into conflict, like any intelligent item, a <i>black blade</i> can attempt to exert its dominance using the items against characters rules. Due to its flexible and powerful nature, a <i>black blade</i> has a nonstandard ego progression. </p>",
