Redemption requires a recommitment to his vow accompanied by an <i>atonement</i> spell. After the redemption, the monk's normal <i>ki</i> pool (without the bonus from the vow) returns. If he upholds the previously broken vow for a full month, his <i>ki</i> pool regains the additional points from taking the vow, and he can decide whether to continue with his vow or forgo his vow without penalty. Once a monk forgoes a vow in this fashion, she can never gain a <i>ki</i> point bonus from that vow.</p><p>A monk may have multiple vows. Their effects and increase to his <i>ki</i> pool stack.
