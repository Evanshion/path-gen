    "body": "<p id=\"ki\"> powers are abilities that draw on the power of a monk's <i>ki</i>. The standard monk has several abilities that count as <i>ki</i> powers, such as wholeness of body, abundant step, and empty body. A qinggong monk can learn additional <i>ki</i> powers, which often replaces a non-<i>ki</i> monk ability such as purity of body. <i>Ki</i> powers are divided into three categories: feats, monk abilities, and spells.</p>",
