    "body": "<p id=\"wisdom-of-the-ancestors\">Once per day, you can enter a trance in which you commune with the spirits of your ancestors. This trance lasts for 10 minutes, which must be uninterrupted and during which you can take no other actions. When you come out of this trance, you have gained mystical insight into the future. At 1st level, this insight acts as an <i>augury</i> spell with 80% effectiveness. At 5th level, the insight takes the form of a <i>divination</i> with 90% effectiveness. At 8th level, the knowledge you gain is equivalent to a <i>commune</i> spell. None of these spell effects require material components.</p>",
