{
    "body": "<p id=\"time-flicker\">As a standard action, you can flicker in and out of time, gaining concealment (as the <i>blur</i> spell). You can use this ability for 1 minute per oracle level that you possess per day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. At 7th level, each time you activate this ability, you can treat it as the <i>blink</i> spell, though each round spent this way counts as 1 minute of your normal time flicker duration. You must be at least 3rd level to select this revelation.</p>",
