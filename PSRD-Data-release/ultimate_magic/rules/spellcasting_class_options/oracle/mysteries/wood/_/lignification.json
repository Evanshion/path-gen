    "body": "<p id=\"lignification\">Once per day, you can turn a creature into wood. As a standard action, you may direct your gaze against a single creature within 30 feet. The targeted creature (along with all its carried gear) must make a Fortitude save or turn into a mindless, inert statue made out of wood for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your oracle level. This ability otherwise functions as a <i>flesh to stone</i> spell, except the target turns to wood instead of stone. This can be reverse by any effect that can reverse <i>flesh to stone</i>. At 15th level, you can use this ability twice per day. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>",
