    "body": "<p id=\"oracle's-curse\">A dual-cursed oracle must choose two curses at 1st level. One of these curses (oracle's choice) never changes its abilities as the oracle gains levels; for example, an oracle with clouded vision never gains darkvision 60 feet, blindsense, or blindsight. The other curse comes with its normal benefits.</p>",
