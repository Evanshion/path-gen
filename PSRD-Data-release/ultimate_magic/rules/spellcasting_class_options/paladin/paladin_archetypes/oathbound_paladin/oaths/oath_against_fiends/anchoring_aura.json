    "body": "<p id=\"anchoring-aura\">At 8th level, a paladin's aura hampers extradimensional travel by evil outsiders. The aura extends 20 feet from the paladin. Evil outsiders attempting to use abilities such as <i>dimension door</i>, <i>plane shift</i>, or <i>teleport</i> to leave or enter the aura must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the paladin's level + the paladin's Charisma modifier); failure means the ability does not function, as if the outsider were affected by <i>dimensional anchor</i>. The aura functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.</p><p>Alternatively, as an immediate action, the paladin can expend one use of her smite evil ability to target an evil outsider within 30 feet with <i>dimensional anchor</i>. A targeted <i>dimensional anchor</i> persists even if the paladin is unconscious or dead.</p><p>This ability replaces aura of resolve.</p>",
