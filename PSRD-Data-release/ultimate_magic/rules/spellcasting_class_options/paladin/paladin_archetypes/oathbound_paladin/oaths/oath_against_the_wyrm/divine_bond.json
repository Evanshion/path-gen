    "body": "<p id=\"divine-bond\">This works like the paladin's normal divine bond ability, except as follows. If the paladin's bond is with a weapon, she cannot use that ability to add the <i>brilliant energy</i>, <i>disruption</i>, or <i>merciful weapon</i> properties, but she can add the <i>bane</i> weapon property (but only against dragons). If the paladin's bond is with her steed, the steed gains the paladin's aura-based immunities and her aura does not affect allies. This replaces the standard divine bond ability.</p>",
