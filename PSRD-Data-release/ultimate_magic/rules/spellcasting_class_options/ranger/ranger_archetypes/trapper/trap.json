    "body": "<p id=\"trap\">At 5th level, a trapper learns how to create a snare trap and one other ranger trap of her choice. At 7th level and every two levels thereafter, she learns another trap. The trapper can use these traps a total number of times per day equal to 1/2 her ranger level + her Wisdom modifier. Once a trap is learned, it can't be unlearned and replaced with a different type of trap. The trapper cannot select an individual trap more than once. This ability replaces the ranger's spells class feature. Trappers do not gain any spells or spellcasting ability, do not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger and spell completion magic items.</p>",
