The creature cannot move from the location of the trap, unless the ranger included a \u201cleash\u201d when setting the trap, in which case the creature is limited to the length of the leash. The trapped creature can escape with an Escape Artist check (DC equal to the trap's DC) as a full-round action. The trap or its leash has a number of hit points equal to 1/2 the ranger's level, or can be burst as a full-round action with a DC 25 Strength check. The trap can hold up to a Medium creature; each extra daily use of the ranger's trap ability spent when the trap is set increases the maximum size of creature the trap can hold. At the ranger's option, if there is a tall object or structure nearby, she can have the trap lift the creature.",
