    "body": "<p id=\"mind-reader\">At 3rd level, you can read minds as a spell-like ability. This ability acts like <i>detect thoughts</i>, except it lasts only 1 round, you use it on a single target as a standard action, and if the target fails its Will save, you gain information as if you had concentrated on it for 3 rounds. You may use this ability once per day at 3rd level and one additional time per day for every four sorcerer levels you possess beyond 3rd, up to five times per day at 20th level.</p>",
