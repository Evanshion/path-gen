This ability acts as an <i>ice storm</i>, except the area is also subject to <i>deeper darkness</i> for 1 round per four sorcerer levels. You may use this ability once per day at 3rd level, and one additional time per day for every three additional levels. The bloodline power replaces aurora borealis.</p>",
