    "body": "<p>The eidolon has the upper torso of a humanoid and the lower body of a quadruped (such as a horse). A centaur eidolon's upper humanoid torso is smaller than its quadrupedal body. As a result, it wields weapons as if it were one size category smaller than its actual size (Medium for most centaur eidolons). The centaur model can also be used to create a lamia (a centaur eidolon with the upper body of a woman and the lower body of a lion) by replacing the hooves evolution with claws and taking basic magic (<i>touch of fatigue</i>), minor magic (<i>ventriloquism</i>), major magic (<i>daze monster</i>), and ultimate magic (<i>major image</i>), resulting in a 23-point model.</p>",
