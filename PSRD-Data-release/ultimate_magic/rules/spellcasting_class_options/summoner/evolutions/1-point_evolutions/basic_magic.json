Select one spell from the following list: <i>acid splash</i>, <i>dancing lights</i>, <i>daze</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>flare</i>, <i>ghost sound</i>, <i>light</i>, <i>mage hand</i>, <i>ray of frost</i>, <i>stabilize</i>, or <i>touch of fatigue</i>. This spell can be cast once per day as a spell-like ability. At 4th level, this spell can be cast three times per day by spending 2 additional evolution points. The caster level for this evolution is equal to the eidolon's Hit Dice. The save DC for this spell is 10 + the eidolon's Charisma modifier. The eidolon must have a Charisma score of at least 10 to take this evolution. This evolution can be selected more than once. Each time an eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a new spell.</p>",
