    "body": "<p id=\"channel-resistance\"> An eidolon becomes less easily affected by the channel energy ability of clerics or paladins. The eidolon gains a +2 bonus on any saves that are made to resist the effects of channel energy, including effects that rely on the use of channel energy (such as the Command Undead feat). At 7th level, this bonus can be increased to +4 by spending 2 additional evolution points. The eidolon must possess the undead appearance evolution to take this evolution.</p>",
