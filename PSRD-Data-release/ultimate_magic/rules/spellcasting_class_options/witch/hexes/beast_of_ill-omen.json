    "body": "<p id=\"beast-of-ill-omen\">The witch imbues her familiar with strange magic, putting a minor curse upon the next enemy to see it. The enemy must make a Will save or be affected by <i>bane</i> (caster level equal to the witch's level). The witch can use this hex on her familiar at a range of up to 60 feet. The affected enemy must be no more than 60 feet from the familiar to trigger the effect; seeing the familiar from a greater distance has no effect (though if the enemy and familiar approach to within 60 feet of each other, the hex takes effect). The <i>bane</i> affects the closest creature to the familiar (ties affect the creature with the highest initiative score). Whether or not the target's save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of the <i>bane</i> effect for 1 day (later uses of this hex ignore that creature when determining who is affected).</p>",
