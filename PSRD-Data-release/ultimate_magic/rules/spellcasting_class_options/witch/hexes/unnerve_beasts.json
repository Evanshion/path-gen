    "body": "<p id=\"unnerve-beasts\">The target becomes offensive to animals (Will negates). Animals become distraught and aggressive in the victim's presence&mdash;horses buck, dogs snap and bark, bulls charge, and so on. The hex lasts a number of hours equal to the witch's Intelligence modifier. A creature that saves against the hex cannot be affected by the hex for 1 day. The reaction of the animals is a mind-affecting charm effect, but the hex on the target is not.</p>",
