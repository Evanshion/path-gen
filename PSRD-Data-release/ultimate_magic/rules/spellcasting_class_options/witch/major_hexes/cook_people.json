    "body": "<p id=\"cook-people\">The witch can create fabulous spells by cooking an intelligent humanoid creature in her cauldron, either alive or dead. Using this hex creates one meal or serving of food of the witch's choice, typically a delicious stew or a dough suitable for cookies, pastries, or other desserts. Cooking the victim takes 1 hour. Eating the food provides one of the following benefits for 1 hour: <i>age resistance</i>, <i>bear's endurance</i>, <i>bull's strength</i>, <i>cat's grace</i>, <i>eagle's splendor</i>, <i>fox's cunning</i>, <i>neutralize poison</i> (instantaneous) <i>owl's wisdom, remove disease</i> (instantaneous). Alternatively, the witch can shape the dough into a Small, humanlike creature, animating it as a homunculus for 1 hour. The witch must have the cauldron hex to select this hex. Using this hex or knowingly eating its food is an evil act.</p>",
