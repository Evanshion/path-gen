    "body": "<p id=\"hoarfrost\">The target is rimed with a shell of frost needles that slowly work their way into its flesh (Fortitude negates). The target turns pale and blue, and takes 1 point of Constitution damage per minute until it dies, saves (once per minute), or is cured. <i>Break enchantment</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, and similar spells end the effect. If the target saves, it is immune to this hex for 1 day. This is a cold effect.</p>",
