    "body": "<p id=\"spontaneous-healing\">A hedge witch can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that she did not prepare ahead of time. The witch can &ldquo;lose&rdquo; any prepared spell that is not an orison in order to cast any <i>cure</i> spell of the same spell level or lower, even if she doesn't know that cure spell. This replaces the witch's hex gained at 4th level.</p>",
