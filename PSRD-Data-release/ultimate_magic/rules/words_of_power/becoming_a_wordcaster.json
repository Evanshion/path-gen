Once made, this choice cannot be changed. A character who elects to be a wordcaster in a spellcasting class typically cannot use the spells of that class (though there are feats that allow a wordcaster to learn and use a limited number of spells; see wordcaster feats), but he can utilize spell trigger and spell completion items just as if he were an ordinary spellcaster of that class.</p>",
