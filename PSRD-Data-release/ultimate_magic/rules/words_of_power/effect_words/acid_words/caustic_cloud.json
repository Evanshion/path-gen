Creatures caught in the cloud take 1d6 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) and are fatigued. Creatures caught in the cloud receive a Fortitude save to halve the damage and to negate the fatigued effect. Creatures that remain in the cloud take a cumulative &ndash;2 penalty on the save each round they remain in the cloud, but spending just 1 round outside the cloud's area resets this penalty. Creatures in the cloud that are fatigued become exhausted on a failed saving throw. A strong wind, such as that created by a <i>gust of wind</i>, disperses this cloud immediately.</p>",
