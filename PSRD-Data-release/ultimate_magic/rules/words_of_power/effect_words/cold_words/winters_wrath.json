Anyone inside the area when it forms, and at the start of the caster's turn, takes 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) and 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. A Fortitude save halves this damage and negates the Dexterity damage. Creatures immune to cold damage do not take the Dexterity damage. Because of the heavy snow and winds, visibility is reduced to 5 feet inside the blizzard. Effects that deal fire damage do not harm anyone inside this blizzard unless they are of a level equal to or higher than the wordspell with this effect word.</p>",
