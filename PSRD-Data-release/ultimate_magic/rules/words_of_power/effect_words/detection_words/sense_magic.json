By concentrating each round, the caster can determine the number and location of each aura in the target area. He can make a Knowledge (arcana) skill check to determine the school of each aura (one check per aura, the DC of this check is 15 + the spell level or 15 + 1/2 the caster level for a nonspell effect). If the aura radiates from a magic item, the caster can attempt to identify the item's properties as if using <i>detect magic</i> (see Spellcraft). If the aura emanates from a spell of 7th level or higher, or is a nonspell effect with a caster level of 12th or higher, the caster knows that the aura is strong, even if the Knowledge check to identify the school is unsuccessful.</p>",
