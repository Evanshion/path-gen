By focusing on one creature in the area, the caster can read the surface thoughts of that creature. The caster must be otherwise aware of the creature to focus on it. A Will save prevents the caster from reading the creature's thoughts for the duration of a wordspell with this effect word. If the target has an Intelligence score at least 10 higher than the caster and it makes its Will save, the target can instead read the surface thoughts of the caster for the duration of the of the wordspell with this effect word, while the wordcaster receives no insight. Each round, the caster can focus on a new creature if he desires.</p>",
