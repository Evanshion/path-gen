All magic effects are suppressed while inside the area. As a result, this word cannot be combined with other effect words. Magic effects cannot cross through the area. Time spent within the field counts against the duration of the suppressed effects. Summoned and incorporeal creatures cannot enter the area and are immediately forced to the nearest edge if inside the area when it forms. Objects still maintain their function while in the area, so a sword still cuts, even if it loses its magical properties.</p>",
