For the duration of the wordspell, the caster always knows the direction and distance to the point where this wordspell was cast. If this word is cast again, the original casting immediately ends. This effect does not instruct the caster on how to reach the point, but rather merely indicates the direction to the point, even if that direction leads through solid objects and other hazards.</p>",
