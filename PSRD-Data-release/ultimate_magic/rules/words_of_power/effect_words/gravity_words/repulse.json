Creatures inside the area when it forms are immediately moved toward its nearest edge. If, because of an obstacle, they cannot reach the edge, they strike the barrier and take falling damage. While a wordspell with this effect word persists, objects cannot enter the area unless they possess the ability to fly. Any flying creatures that rely on wings and enter the area must immediately make a DC 25 Fly skill check or be repelled by the area, unable to enter this turn. Missile weapons that pass through this area automatically miss their target. The caster is immune to this effect and may enter the area freely.</p>",
