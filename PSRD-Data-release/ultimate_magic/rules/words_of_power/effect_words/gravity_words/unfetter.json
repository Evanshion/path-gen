They treat up as down and down as up. This can cause the creatures to take falling damage when they hit the ceiling or another surface above them. This effect applies to the targets and all of their gear, so long as it remains on their person. Thrown and missile weapons interact with gravity normally, but the disorientation caused by unfetter means the target takes a &ndash;4 penalty on such attacks. When a wordspell with this effect word ends, the targets fall to the ground unless they have some means of staying aloft.</p>",
