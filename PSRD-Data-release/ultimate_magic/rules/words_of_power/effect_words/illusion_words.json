The sound's volume increases with the caster's level. The base Perception DC to notice this sound is 0, but the DC is reduced by 1 per caster level (although it can be higher if the caster desires). This means that the sound starts out as loud as a creature talking, but by 10th level, it is as loud as creatures engaged in a noisy battle. The sound can resemble anything the caster desires, except it cannot replicate speech or language. Once cast, the type of sound within the emanation cannot be changed.</p>",

It can otherwise have any appearance the caster desires. The caster can change the illusion's movements by concentrating, but it cannot leave its initial area.</p>",
