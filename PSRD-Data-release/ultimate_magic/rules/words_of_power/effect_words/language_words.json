If the caster chooses magic as the language, the target can decipher scrolls, glyphs, and other magic writing without triggering them. A wordspell with this effect word does not impart the ability to determine what a given language is based on its appearance; the caster must already know the language or guess what language the writing is in to do so.</p>",
