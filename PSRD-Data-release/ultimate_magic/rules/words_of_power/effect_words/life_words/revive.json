The soul of the target receives a clear image of the caster, and can choose not to return, causing the wordspell to fail. If the soul is willing, the target does not receive a saving throw.</p><p>The target is restored to life with 1 hit point, unless another effect word adds to this total. In addition, the target loses 50% of any prepared spells or spell slots it had before it died (determined randomly). Coming back from the dead in this way is an ordeal, and the target gains three permanent negative levels from the experience (if the target does not have at least 4 Hit Dice, a wordspell with this effect word has no effect).</p><p>While this effect word undoes any mortal wounds the target might possess, its body must otherwise be whole for the effect word to function. Any missing parts are still missing when the creature is restored. Normal poisons and diseases are cured as well, but magical afflictions remain. Undead creatures are unaffected by a wordspell with this effect word, as are the dead bodies of creatures that were undead. Constructs and outsiders cannot be restored to life by this effect word. Targets that died as a result of old age cannot be restored to life by this effect word.</p>",
