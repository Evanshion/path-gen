If a creature is in the area of the wall when it forms, that creature can make a Reflex save to avoid the damage entirely. Creatures that pass through the wall can make a Reflex save to halve the damage. Regardless of the outcome of their roll, they still move through the wall. This wall provides cover to creatures on the other side, but does not block line of sight.</p>",
