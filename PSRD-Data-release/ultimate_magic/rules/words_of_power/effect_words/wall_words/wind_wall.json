This wind does not obscure sight, but missile weapons that pass through the wall automatically miss (with the exception of large missiles, such as giant-thrown rocks and siege weapons). Creatures that pass through the wall treat it as difficult terrain and must make a DC 10 Strength check. Failure indicates that the creature cannot pass through the wall this round, but may try again in future rounds. Gases, gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in <i>gaseous form</i> cannot pass through the wall.</p>",
