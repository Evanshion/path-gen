The target can change the conditions by shifting the weather one step at a time up or down a scale of weather effects. The scale is as follows: freezing cold, blizzard, snow, cold rain, cold wind, calm, warm wind, warm rain, thunderstorm, tornado, extreme heat. Each change takes 10 minutes to fully take effect. Thus if the weather currently features warm wind and the caster wanted to change that to cold wind, she would need to first change the weather to calm, and then to cold wind. The target cannot control the specifics of the weather, merely what type of weather is occurring (the target cannot, for example, make lightning strike a house, but it can cause lighting to strike within the area). </p>",
