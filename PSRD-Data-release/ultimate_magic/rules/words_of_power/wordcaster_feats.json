    "body": "<p>Metamagic feats, such as Empower Spell and Quicken Spell, work on wordspells just like they would on ordinary spells. The increase to the spell's level means that the spell uses up a higher-level spell slot, but retains the word arrangement of the affected spell. For example, a 3rd-level wordspell modified by the Empower Spell feat would use up a 5th-level spell slot, but could not contain words with a level higher than 3rd.</p><p>In addition, wordcasters can take the following feats to augment their casting capabilities.</p>",
