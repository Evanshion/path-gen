It gains a +2 bonus on all rolls, including damage rolls and special ability DCs, a +4 bonus to AC and CMD, and +2 hit points per HD. The animal's primal instincts take hold for the duration of this spell&mdash;if the animal knows tricks granted by the Handle Animal skill, it loses access to all of those tricks save for &ldquo;attack.&rdquo; This spell has no effect on animals that already have the advanced creature template.</p>",
