    "body": "<p>This spell functions as <i>teleport</i>, except there is truly no range limit and you do not need to have seen your destination, though you must have a solid grasp of which world you wish to travel to (&ldquo;the third planet from the sun&rdquo; is an acceptable destination, but &ldquo;a habitable world near that bright star&rdquo; is not). If you have a specific location on a planet in mind, you arrive there without a chance of failure; otherwise you arrive at a location that would not immediately be life-threatening. If no such safe landing zone exists on the world, such as someone attempting to travel into the sun without the proper precautions in place, the spell simply fails.</p>",
