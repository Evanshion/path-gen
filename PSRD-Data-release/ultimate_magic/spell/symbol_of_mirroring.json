These duplicates function as <i>mirror image</i>, moving with the original creatures and mimicking their movements, sounds, and actions exactly. If an illusory double is destroyed, a new one appears on the creature's turn. The images last for as long as a creature remains within 60 feet of the symbol, and for 1 round/level thereafter. Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p><p><i>Symbol of mirroring</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 10th level or higher for the cost of 5,000 gp.</p>",
