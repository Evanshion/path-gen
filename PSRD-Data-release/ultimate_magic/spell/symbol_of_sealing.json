    "body": "<p>This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon or above a door or other opening measuring no more than 20 square feet/level in size. When the casting is completed, the symbol immediately triggers, glowing visibly and sealing the door or opening with an invisible barrier of force equivalent to a <i>wall of force</i>. Destroying the symbol ends the effect, though destroying it once the symbol has been activated requires destroying the <i>wall of force</i> first. Once triggered, the wall remains for 10 minutes per caster level.</p><p>When scribing a <i>symbol of sealing</i>, you can specify a password or phrase that allows a creature speaking it to bypass the seal and pass through the opening. You can also attune any number of creatures to the <i>symbol of sealing</i>, but doing this extends the casting time as described under <i>symbol of death</i>. However, the force wall created by the symbol blocks attacks and line of effect even for creatures that know the password or are attuned&mdash;the password only prevents them from triggering the symbol, not from ignoring its effects if triggered.</p><p>A <i>disintegrate</i> spell or similar effect can destroy the wall of force created by the symbol if the caster makes a caster level check against a DC of 11 + your caster level. A <i>knock</i> spell has no effect on a <i>symbol of sealing</i> or its force wall. A <i>symbol of sealing</i> cannot be dispelled, but <i>mage's disjunction</i> automatically destroys it.</p>",
