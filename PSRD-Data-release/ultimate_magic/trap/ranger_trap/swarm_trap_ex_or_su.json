The swarm remains in the general area for no longer than 1 round per ranger level, after which it disperses. If the trap is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must provide the creatures of the swarm (typically in a small box, cage, or crate); these creatures may die of starvation before the trap is triggered (an extraordinary trap lasts 1 day per level).",
